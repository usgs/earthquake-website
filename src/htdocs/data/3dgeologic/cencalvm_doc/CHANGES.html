<div class="textblock"><p>Summary of changes made to cencalvm query software. </p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver080"></a>
Version 0.8.0, 2011/05/26</h2>
<ul>
<li>Updated documentation with availability of elevation query value.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver070"></a>
Version 0.7.0, 2010/11/18</h2>
<ul>
<li>Switched from Pyrex/Pyrexembed to SWIG for extension (use as a spatialdatabase).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver066"></a>
Version 0.6.6, 2010/01/18</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added missing include directives to fix compilation errors with recent gcc versions.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver065"></a>
Version 0.6.5, 2008/05/14</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved Makefiles so that files are not removed by 'make clean' when the building in the source tree. When building outside the source tree, data files copied from the source tree are removed from the build tree. </li>
<li>Switched from linking Fortran example query code with C++ compiler to linking with Fortran compiler. This appears to fix build problems with the Intel compiler, but may required adding C++ libraries to the link line for the Sun compiler (by passing arguments to configure).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver064"></a>
Version 0.6.4, 2008/04/10</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug for finding elevation in extended model (cannot allow use of interior octants). Bug affected squashing as well as queries for elevation of ground surface.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver063"></a>
Version 0.6.3, 2008/04/02</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug for finding elevation in extended model (found flag always false). Bug affected squashing as well as queries for elevation of ground surface. Added sample data files for USGS Bay Area Velocity Model 08.2.0.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver062"></a>
Version 0.6.2, 2008/04/01</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bugs related to setting squashing flag in C and C++ examples (it was always turned on). Fixed bug in determining elevation using depth from free surface (limited to querying for elevation; squashing was not affected).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver061"></a>
Version 0.6.1, 2008/03/31</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added C and Fortran bindings to squash().</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver060"></a>
Version 0.6.0, 2008/02/06</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added ability to query for elevation of topography/bathymetry and squash topography/bathymetry to retain low-velocity material when using the velocity model in models with a flat ground surface. Added extension to the query routines for Python to allow seamless integration into PyLith via CIG's spatialdata software. These new features can be used with any release of the velocity model.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver050"></a>
Version 0.5.0, 2007/02/21</h2>
<ul>
<li>Simplified code layout. Condensed multiple libraries into one main library. No changes were made to the API, so the only changes users will need to make is to adjust their linking to simply use "-lcenvalvm".</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver041"></a>
Version 0.4.1, 2006/03/21</h2>
<ul>
<li>Restructured geometry routines in order to generalize geometry interface. Etree databases with different geometries (different locations) can now use the same query routines. The default geometry is the one for central CA; this can be changed via VMQuery::geometry(). </li>
<li>Improved compliance with C++ standards which eliminated compiler warnings for some compilers. </li>
<li>Miscellaneous minor improvements in documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver040"></a>
Version 0.4.0, 2005/11/05</h2>
<ul>
<li>Restructured query routines, adding the ability to query the regional model, if desired. </li>
<li>Updated sample input and output data files to be compatible with release 05.1.0 of the USGS Bay Area Velocity Model, including the abilty to use the regional model, if desired. </li>
<li>Created extension of VMQuery to be compatible with CIG spatialdata package. This will only be of use in CIG code. Building this extension is turned off by default. </li>
<li>Fixed bug in query routines where projection routine was called twice. Second, superfluous call was removed. This should speed up queries a very slight amount.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver030"></a>
Version 0.3.0, 2005/10/07</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed examples to include FIXEDRES and WAVERES query types. Improved instructions for the examples. </li>
<li>Turned on averaging of water points but do not allow mixing of averaging of water and solid material points in averaging by giving solid material points precedence (if attempting to mix the two, ignore the water values). </li>
<li>Fixed FIXEDRES and WAVERES queries so averaged values aren't used when query wants finer resolution than available. For example, if you want values at 200m resolution and a search says only values at 800m are available, then this location is a "void" at 200m resolution so "NODATA" should be returned instead of the values at 800m. Previous versions would return values at the 800m resolution. </li>
<li>Switched to GNU build system for easier installtion and portability. Users now run configure to generate Makefiles instead of creating them by hand.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver022"></a>
Version 0.2.2, 2005/08/10</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug where inclusion of assert header file was missing in several source files. This resulted in compiler errors in some cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver021"></a>
Version 0.2.1, 2005/08/03</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed bug in creation routine where Vs for water (-999) was scaled. 'No data' values should not be scaled. The query routine was adjusted to undo this scaling, so 'no data' values will now be consistent. </li>
<li>Fixed bug in MAXRES query routine. Interior octants were returned in search of etree. Now if an interior octant is returned, the values are set to 'no data'. This only occurred when querying the etree at locations above topography and the water surface. </li>
<li>Added 'no data' and water points to examples for illustration of those cases. </li>
<li>Added ability to make creation/averaging routines run quietly (no progress reports). </li>
<li>Fixed bug in cencalvmcquery where filenames were not initialized to empty string. This created filenames from garbage and log files tended to created by default which is not the desired behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver020"></a>
Version 0.2.0, 2005/07/29</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added error handler to allow queries to continue even when values cannnot be found for locations. Coordinates of locations where data was not found can be written to a log file. Values for locations not found are set to predefined value (see <a class="el" href="libsrc_2query_2README.html">libsrc/query/README </a> for details). </li>
<li>Fixed bugs in C and C++ examples associated with setting values to be returned in a query. </li>
<li>Fixed documentation for units of cache size. Units are MB. </li>
<li>Added average package for creating database with spatial averaging. </li>
<li>Finished implementing routines and unit testing of queries at fixed resolution or resolution based on wavelength of shear wave.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver011"></a>
Version 0.1.1, 2005/07/18</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed errors in documentation and updated Make.mm files in examples directory to reflect name of database in release pre1.0.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="ver010"></a>
Version 0.1.0, 2005/07/09</h2>
