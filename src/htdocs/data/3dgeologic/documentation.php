  <p>
    The detailed model is surrounded by the regional (extended) model to permit capturing large length scale features of seismic wave propagation along the northern San Andreas fault outside the domain of the detailed model. In the regional model details away from the San Andreas fault are grossly generalized in places. The regional model fits around the detailed model so it does not include the region covered by the detailed model.
  </p>

  <p>
  The detailed and regional velocity models are rectangular volumes in a Transverse Mercator (TM) projection with the following parameters:
  <ul>
    <li>Scale factor for central meridian: 0.99960000</li>
    <li>Longitude of central meridian: -123.00000</li>
    <li>Latitude of origin: 35.00000</li>
    <li>False easting: 0.00000</li>
    <li>False northing: 0.00000</li>
    <li>Azimuths of sides: 53.638, 323.638</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Geologic Block Model</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
The detailed and regional (extended) 3-D geologic models of Central California, centered on the San Francisco Bay region, were made using the Dynamic Graphics <a href="http://www.dgi.com/">EarthVision(TM)</a> software.  This
program builds 3-D models starting with a hierarchy of fault surfaces that divide the volume of interest into <b>Fault Blocks</b>.  These fault blocks are further subdivided by <b>Zone Surfaces</b> that most commonly represent contacts between rock units within a fault block.
</p>

<p>
Fault and zone surfaces were exported from the EarthVision (EV) model using an EV utility named "ev_ev2gocad", which outputs a file in the TSurf format</a> used by the <a href="http://www.earthdecision.com/home.html">GOCAD(TM) software</a>.  The TSurf format represents a surface by specifying the locations a number of triangles which approximate the surface.
</p>

<p>
Various options for viewing TSurf files may be found under "Tools" on the <a
href="http://structure.harvard.edu/cfm/tools.html">SCEC Community Fault Model</A> website.  There are also scripts
available in the tarball to project the tsurfs and to convert the projected versions to the <B>.vtp</B> format for viewing in the <a href="http://www.paraview.org/">ParaView</a> 3-D visualization software.

<h2>Seismic Velocity Model</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
The velocity model is stored in <a href="http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~euclid/">Etree database</a> files. We provide a library to query the database from C++, C, and Fortran 77. The query software is called cencalvm (current version is 0.6.5) and is generally updated independently of the velocity model. In order to use the seismic velocity model, you need to download the Etree database file for the detailed model and install the query software. Downloading the Etree database file for the regional (extended) model is optional.
