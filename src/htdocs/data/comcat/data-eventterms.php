              The depth where the earthquake begins to rupture. This depth may
              be relative to mean sea-level or the average elevation of the
              seismic stations which provided arrival-time data for the
              earthquake location. The choice of reference depth is dependent on
              the method used to locate the earthquake. Sometimes when depth is
              poorly constrained by available seismic data, the location program
              will set the depth at a fixed value. For example, 33 km is often
              used as a default depth for earthquakes determined to be shallow,
              but whose depth is not satisfactorily determined by the data,
              whereas default depths of 5 or 10 km are often used in
              mid-continental areas and on mid-ocean ridges since earthquakes in
              these areas are usually shallower than 33 km.

              An earthquake begins to rupture at a hypocenter which is defined
              by a position on the surface of the earth (epicenter) and a depth
              below this point (focal depth). We provide the coordinates of the
              epicenter in units of latitude and longitude. The latitude is the
              number of degrees north (N) or south (S) of the equator and varies
              from 0 at the equator to 90 at the poles. The longitude is the
              number of degrees east (E) or west (W) of the prime meridian which
              runs through Greenwich, England. The longitude varies from 0 at
              Greenwich to 180 and the E or W shows the direction from
              Greenwich. Coordinates are given in the <a

              The magnitude reported is that which the U.S. Geological Survey
              considers official for this earthquake, and was the best available
              estimate of the earthquake’s size, at the time that this page was
              created. Other magnitudes associated with web pages linked from
              here are those determined at various times following the
              earthquake with different types of seismic data. Although they are
              legitimate estimates of magnitude, the U.S. Geological Survey does
              not consider them to be the preferred "official" magnitude for the
              event.
            </p>
            <p>
              Earthquake magnitude is a measure of the size of an earthquake at
              its source. It is a logarithmic measure.  At the same distance
              from the earthquake, the amplitude of the seismic waves from which
              the magnitude is determined are approximately 10 times as large
              during a magnitude 5 earthquake as during a magnitude 4
              earthquake. The total amount of energy released by the earthquake
              usually goes up by a larger factor: for many commonly used
              magnitude types, the total energy of an average earthquake goes up
              by a factor of approximately 32 for each unit increase in
              magnitude.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are various ways that magnitude may be calculated
              from seismograms. Different methods are effective for different
              sizes of earthquakes and different distances between the
              earthquake source and the recording station. The various magnitude
              types are generally defined so as to yield magnitude values that
              agree to within a few-tenths of a magnitude-unit for earthquakes
              in a middle range of recorded-earthquake sizes, but the various
              magnitude-types may have values that differ by more than a
              magnitude-unit for very large and very small earthquakes as well
              as for some specific classes of seismic source. This is because
              earthquakes are commonly complex events that release energy over a
              wide range of frequencies and at varying amounts as the faulting
              or rupture process occurs.  The various types of magnitude measure
              different aspects of the seismic radiation (e.g., low-frequency
              energy vs. high-frequency energy). The relationship among values
              of different magnitude types that are assigned to a particular
              seismic event may enable the seismologist to better understand the
              processes at the focus of the seismic event.  The various
              magnitude-types are not all available at the same time for a
              particular earthquake.
            </p>
            <p>Preliminary magnitudes based on incomplete
              but rapidly-available data are sometimes estimated and reported.
              For example, the Tsunami Warning Centers will calculate a
              preliminary magnitude and location for an event as soon as
              sufficient data are available to make an estimate. In this case,
              time is of the essence in order to broadcast a warning if tsunami
              waves are likely to be generated by the event. Such preliminary
              magnitudes are superseded by improved estimates of magnitude as
              more data become available.

            <p>
              For large earthquakes of the present
              era, the magnitude that is ultimately selected as the preferred
              magnitude for reporting to the public is commonly a moment
              magnitude that is based on the scalar seismic-moment of an
              earthquake determined by calculation of the seismic moment-tensor
              that best accounts for the character of the seismic waves
              generated by the earthquake.  The scalar seismic-moment, a
              parameter of the seismic moment-tensor, can also be estimated via
              the multiplicative product rigidity of faulted rock x area of
              fault rupture x average fault displacement during the earthquake.

            Time when the event occurred. Times are reported in <em>
            milliseconds</em> since the epoch (

              We indicate the date and time when the earthquake initiates
              rupture, which is known as the "origin" time. Note that large
              earthquakes can continue rupturing for many 10's of seconds. We
              provide time in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). Seismologists
              use UTC to avoid confusion caused by local time zones and daylight
              savings time. On the individual event pages, times are also
              provided for the time at the epicenter, and your local time based
              on the time your computer is set.

            This flag is set to "1" for large events in oceanic regions and "0"
            otherwise. <strong>The existence or value of this flag does not
            indicate if a tsunami actually did or will exist</strong>. If the
            flag value is "1", the event will include a link to the NOAA Tsunami
            website for tsunami information. The USGS is not responsible for
            Tsunami warning; we are simply providing a link to the authoritative
            NOAA source.
