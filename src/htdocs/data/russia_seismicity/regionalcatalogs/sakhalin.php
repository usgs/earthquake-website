<h2>Sakhalin Seismicity Map and Composite Regional Catalog</h2>
<a href="../download/sakhalin.ZIP">EXCEL</a><br />

<p>
  The Regional Sakhalin Catalog, 1962-1999, includes 539 earthquakes from the General Catalog and 146 from the Obninsk Bulletin. At present, no data from local seismological centers are available in electronic format.
</p>
<p>
  One hundred six events from the Obninsk Bulletin are in 1991-1999, other 40 mostly duplicate in the General Catalog, but only 3 have identical parameters. Other events have slightly different origin time or/and coordinates in the Obninsk Bulletin and the General Catalog. As in the other Far East Regions, there are many deep earthquakes in Sakhalin.
