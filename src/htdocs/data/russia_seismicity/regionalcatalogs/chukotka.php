  In the Chukotka region, the earthquakes located in the Western hemisphere are signed in longitude greater than 180 East (up to 195 East) as a convenience for database processing.  Only two earthquakes were known before the installation of the seismic station Iultin, in 19__ (unfortunately, Iultin is now closed).  Since 1970, many small earthquake were located, with 7 &lt; K 	&lt; 9.  To check for explosions in ESSN catalog, the time-of-day distribution was made for small events, (K 	&gt; 10), as follows:

  Two peaks are seen, corresponding to GMT from 1 to 4 and about 21-23.  Local time here is about 10 hours later. So the first clear peak corresponds to 12-14 pm (lunch break), and the second one to 7-8 am (morning).  This suggests that about fifty events (of a total of 379 small events in the ESSN  catalog) are industrial blasts.   The total number of earthquakes in the Composite Regional Catalog for Chukotka during 1962-1999 is, therefore, as little as about 450.  Nevertheless, 38 earthquakes have occurred with at least one of the three (Obn) magnitudes (MLH, Msps, Mlpl) of 5.0 or more, and six with M ³ 6.
