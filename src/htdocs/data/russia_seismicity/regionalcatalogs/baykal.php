  The Baykal region (48-58N; 100-122E) can be divided on three parts with different kinds of seismicity:  Baykal Lake, itself, and branches of secondary rift zones are of high level of seismicity; Southeast of Lake Baykal, the seismicity appears scattered, with no clear structure; Northwest of Lake Baykal, there were very few earthquakes recorded by the network, although there are a number of events from industrial blasting in quarries.

<p>
  Careful paleoseismic study in this region has resulted in the identification of 30 earthquakes in the period from year 200 till the end of the nineteenth century [REF].  Historical information was found for more than 250 earthquakes, and their time, location and magnitudes were estimated by _ [REF].  The General Catalog includes 558 earthquakes for the time period before 1961.  Since 1955, the Obninsk Bulletin contains 17 earthquakes; 8 of these have identical parameters in the General Catalog.

  In the first few years of the operation of the local network, the lower limit of event size for inclusion in the catalog was about Energy Class K=7; nevertheless, about 100 earthquakes with 5 < K < 6 were reported.  The number of events reported during the five-year period from 1962-1966 is 5,394 (more than a thousand per year.  In 1967, the lower limit of Energy Class for publication was raised, to K=9.  During the 23 years from 1967 until 1990, the average number of earthquakes in catalog decreased by two-thirds, to an average of about 300 per year.
