<h2>Western Russia Seismicity Map and Composite Regional Catalog</h2>
<a href="../download/russia.ZIP">EXCEL</a><br />

<p>
  We have cataloged the seismicity of Western Russia in three regions, North Russia, Central Russia and South Russia (see geographic regionalization map).
</p>

<h3>North Russia Region</h3>
<p>(58-70N; 30-52E)</p>

<p>
  The local seismic survey is located in Apatity, near the center of the mining and quarring industry. That survey has monitored the natural seismicity around the White Sea and Spitsbergen, where the seismic station Piramida operates. The most attention is paid to the blasting at few quarries close to Apatity station. Their data does not regularly appear in the Annual (ESSN) catalog. The largest number of reported events was between 1987 and 1990, and the overall numbers of events does not represent the overall level of both natural and industrial seismic activity.
</p>
<p>
  In the early instrumental period, the local seismicity was studied by the Panasenko, working at the Apatity station. His catalog data are included in the General Catalog. Recent papers in the Annual described the natural seismicity around the White Sea, which in interpreted to result from the same general tectonic process as that of all Scandinavia.
</p>
<p>
  The regional catalog of events includes the epicenters at southern part of region: Karelia and the great Lakes, Ladoga and Onega. There are also historical data for some natural earthquakes there.
</p>
<p>
  The time-of-day distribution of events in the earthquake catalog from 1967-1990 is as follows:
</p>

<p>
  While many recent events have beene recorded, there are no data in the Annual useful for the discrimination earthquakes and explosions (other than origin time). The Apatity explosions begin in the early morning, about 5-6 local time, and continue until 1900h --very few are found at night. The apparent dependence of the number of events in earthquake catalog upon the time of day (most occur from 6 to 18 GMT; or 9-21 local time) is evidence that most events are explosions. This daytime distribution of events suggests that most of these events are explosions. But some, about 10 or more are probably natural earthquakes. Approximately 10-15 --from total about 150-- are not many, but they deserve to get attention.
</p>
<p>
  The list of announced explosions near Apatity in 1991-1992 was published with their location (mines) and the charge pointed. These data are published elsewhere, in a separate catalog.
</p>

<h3>Central Russia Region</h3>
<p>(52-58N; 30-52E)</p>

<p>
  Most seismological data for this region are historical, beginning from 1467. Half of 18 earthquakes occurred before 1900, the other half occurred from 1900 to 1956. Four events are duplicated in the different source catalogs, and their parameters, such as time, intensity (Io) and magnitude (M) are not the same. Four events listened in the General Catalog, and other ones (marked as Historical, "Hist”) were taken from collection by Nikonov and Anayin, scattered in different publications. Only one event was found in the Obninsk Bulletin catalog. No local seismic survey was here. Western surveys, such as ISC and NOA, recorded eight events at this area, between the years 1968-1989. They were apparently missed by Russian seismological stations. So this region is almost a "blank spot".
