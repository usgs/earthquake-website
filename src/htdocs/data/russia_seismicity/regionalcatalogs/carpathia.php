  Because this region includes a territory of ancient high civilization, historical information for large earthquakes was found as early as about 500 years BC.  In the General Catalog, 90 earthquakes were reported for the period before 1990, with magnitudes between 5.8 and 8.0; 363 more events are reported from the early instrumental period, 1900-1961.  Among these, only 24 (about 5%) have estimated depths of 50 km or more.  This contrasts sharply with the 495 deep earthquakes, of a total of 637, in the 1962-1999 period.  This discrepancy may be because the deeper events produced smaller macroseismic effects and were, therefore, rarely noted in historical records.
