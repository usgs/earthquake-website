<h2>Laptev Sea Region Seismicity Map and Composite Regional Catalog</h2>
<a href="../download/laptev.ZIP">EXCEL</a><br />
<p>(70-76N; 110-150)</p>

<p>
  The Laptev Sea zone is where the Middle Arctic Ocean seismic belt abuts the continental shelf of Siberia. In the beginning of the XX century, several earthquakes as large as M=5.5-6.8 occurred here. The very poor seismic network here makes the seismicity badly known. In 1968, the SevMorGeo Institute (Geology of the North Sea) began seismological observations here, using a few temporary seismic stations. Observation was possible only in the summers. The instrumentation was by VEGIK with a flat frequency response 0.8-10 Hz and magnification about 30-40X.

<p>
  During 1985-1988, the observations were done in the delta of Lena River. During this period (9 months) 140 earthquakes were recorded, and 121 of them were located. Nevertheless, the time of observation was so short, that the data obtained becomes important for understanding this zone, where the mid-oceanic ridge transforms into scattered continental seismicity.
