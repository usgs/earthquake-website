  In the Urals, Both rock bursts and quarry blasts are probably numerous, but no data are available with which to characterize them.  Only in the last few years does the study of Ural seismicity begin in Kazan and Tataria.

  In the Novaya Zemlya region, a prolongation of the Ural orogenic belt, there were no seismic surveys until recently.  Seismologists were interested more in the higher seismic activity in the Far East, Yakutia, Baikal, Central Asia, and the Caucasus.  Some data on earthquakes were obtained from historical documents.  Regarding modern earthquakes, the ESSN data are an anomaly, or "local result"; i.e., they were recorded during a deep seismic profiling study in 1988-89.
