<h2>Western Siberia Seismicity Map and Composite Regional Catalog</h2>

<p>
  Western Siberia is a region of quite low seismicity. Only 30 earthquakes are known, the largest of which is a questionable magnitude 6.5 earthquake in May, 1827 (reported in the General Catalog). Since 1962, the largest earthquake located here had a magnitude of about M=4. We have not yet compiled a more complete description of earthquakes in this region, which are poorly studied.
