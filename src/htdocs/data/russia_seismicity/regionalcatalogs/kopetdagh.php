<h2>Kopet Dagh Seismicity Map and Composite Regional Catalog</h2>

(35-45N; 52-65E)

<p>
  Kopetdag is a seismically unique region within the territory of the former Soviet Union. It is in several ways analogous to the San Andreas fault zone in California, marked by the clock-wise strike-slip. The structure of the crust differs sharply on the opposite sides of fault. Seismicity located on the South-West side of it and absent at opposite side. Earthquakes have low-frequency spectra, typical for situation like that. Only the Balkhan massif play role of a barrier, resisting slippage â€“ Note that high-frequency earthquakes occur here.

  The Region is also the site of ancient agriculture and civilization. V.Trifonov (personal communication, T. Rautian) studied the ancient irrigation system here. It consists of underground channels (to prevent evaporation in the hot dry climate), transporting water from the mountain rivers to the plants. Trifonov found that the few, old (about 5 thousand years ago) disruptions to channels were due to clock-wise slip with displacements up to a half-meter. These disruptions were repaired, and the curved channels keep working. These data not listed yet in the General Catalog as an ancient large earthquake.

  The General Catalog begins from earthquake approximately 2,000 BC, During the period (before 1962) the General Catalog lists 265 earthquakes. Tree of them are of M = 7-7.3, four ones have M = 6.0-6.9, 43 events are in a 5-5.9 magnitude range. In one case the estimation of depth is 160 km. It is not at Kopetdag itself, but probably marked the North-West end of Hindu Kush deep earthquake zone.

  After the local network begins operate, the number of earthquakes in Catalog increased. In General 1,294 events listed in 1962-1990, in the Obninsk Bulletin, 378 events. Among them 106 events are at period 1991-1999, 14 are identically duplicated in The General Catalog.

  Four aftershocks of the Gazli, M=7, earthquakes --two of them in 1976 and two in 1984-- have a "normal" depths in the Obninsk Bulletin, but are estimated as deep as 60 and 160 km in the General Catalog. These solutions seem unproven. To get more reliable results the lateral differences in the structure of crust have to be taken into account carefully. The temporal seismic station from Garm (ChISS, or frequency band pass filter station), working in epicenter did nor record any aftershock with S-P, correspondent to the depth 160 or even 50 km, only about 5-10 km. The west end of Kopetdag is in the Caspian Sea and extends as the Main Caucasian Ridge. The depths of many earthquakes in the Caspian Sea are estimated to be about 50-60 km. Some indirect characteristics of seems to be corresponds to such estimation. But if take into account the strong lateral difference on the crust structure (tens km of soft sediments on the North-East side of Kopetdag fault and crystalline rocks on the surface at West-South side) at processing of data, the previous depth estimations can be found seriously changed.
