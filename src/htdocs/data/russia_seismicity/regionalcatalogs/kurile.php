<p>
  The Kurily (in Russian, "smoking") Islands region is of high seismicity. In the General Catalog, one can see many large events, beginning in 1737.

<p>
  The local catalog data for this Region are still unavailable in digital format and are not included in the Composite Regional Catalog. However, the energy class, KFS (after Fedotov) or Kc (after Soloviev &amp; Solovieva), were the source for the magnitude (M) calculation that was included in the General Catalog.
