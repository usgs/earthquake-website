  The territory of the Caucasus Region (38-46.5N; 37-52E) includes Azerbaijan, Georgia, Armenia and the Russian North Caucasus.  Six large events here are known from the period BC; twenty in the first millennium, and 292 in the years between 1000 and 1990.  In the early instrumental period (1900-1961), 483 events were reported, or about 700 per year.  Between 1962 and 1966, the minimum published energy class, K, was 6-7, and during this time 3484 earthquakes were included in catalog.  Beginning from 1967 the minimum level of K was increased to 9, with the goal of making the catalog more representative geographically as discussed above.  As a result, during the 23 years from 1967 to 1990, the average number of events per year was halved.  Note that several earthquakes about 100 km deep were reported beneath the Main Caucasian Ridge.
