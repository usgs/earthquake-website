The PGA and PGV directivities are moderate (&nu; ~ 0.75&beta;) and well-constrained. Both rupture directions are mostly updip and favor the NW-SE striking nodal plane as the fault plane, although both rupture directions lie 20° west of the nodal plane. The earthquake appears to have occurred on the Pinole Fault. The nodal planes are projected on the upper hemisphere. All the stations used are within 95 km of the fault.
