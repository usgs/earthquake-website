<h2>Two Contrasting Models of Lithospheric Structure</h2>

<p>The subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate beneath North
        America changes markedly along the length of the subduction zone, notably
        in the angle of subduction, distribution of earthquakes, volcanism, geologic
        and seismic structure of the upper plate, and regional horizontal stress.
        To investigate these characteristics, we conducted detailed density modeling
        experiments of the crust and mantle along two transects across the Cascadia
        subduction zone. One crosses Vancouver Island and the Canadian margin,
        and the other crosses the margin of central Oregon. Both
        density models were constructed independently to a depth of approximately
        50 km. We gathered all possible geologic, geophysical, and borehole data
        to constrain the density calculations. The final densities for the Oregon
        and Vancouver lithosphere models were obtained from gravity inversions.</p>
			<p>Our results confirm that the downgoing slab of the Cascadia
        subduction zone dips significantly steeper beneath Oregon than beneath
        Vancouver Island, lending support to the idea that the Juan de Fuca plate
        is segmented from north to south. In addition, our gravity models indicate
        that the mantle wedge beneath western Oregon (i.e., below the western
        Cascades) is lighter than the mantle beneath the Canadian continental
        crust. This low density agrees with the low mantle velocities observed
        in the mantle and the present day extensional regime of the Pacific Northwest.</p>
			<p>A gravity low at the deformation front of the Oregon margin,
absent along the Vancouver margin, can be explained by the different bathymetry
of the two regions and by the depth to the top of the subducting Juan de
Fuca plate. If the accretionary prisms along these profiles were modeled
with equal densities, a density inhomogeneity in the lower part of the
models would be necessary. Thus that the density of the accretionary prism
for the Vancouver profile must be approximately 0.1-0.2 g/cm<sup>3</sup> greater than
that for Oregon. A density difference within the accretionary prisms also
agrees with other data. We note that the volume of accreted sediments is
approximately twice as large along the Vancouver profile than along the
Oregon profile, and the prism reaches a greater depth (approximately 20
km as compared with 12 km for the Oregon profile). This implies that the
sediments within the accretionary prism at Vancouver Island are at a higher
metamorphic grade, and therefore have higher densities.</p>
<p>We find that a substantial part of the coastal gravity
maxima for both lines is caused by increasing density with depth in the
subducting plate. In the proposed model, the maximum possible density of
the slab was used to satisfy constraints for the average density of the
near coastal crust for both profiles. If a density increase with depth
is not introduced into the model, very high densities would be required
for the near surface coastal and continental crustal blocks.</p>
