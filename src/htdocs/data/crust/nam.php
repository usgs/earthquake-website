<p>These maps depict the seismic properties of North America
  and the surrounding oceanic basins. Figure 1 shows the location
  of data that has been collected for this study. The crustal thickness map was constructed using over 1700
  data points (dots), of which more than 1300 are designated continental crust.
  Figure 2 shows the types of geologic provinces found in
  North America. These may be compared to the underlying crustal thickness map
  also shown in Figure 2.</p>

      One feature of this map
  is an extension of the thin crust of the Basin and Range Province into Western
  Canada. The contour interval is 10 km; a contour representing 45 km (dashed line) is also included.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Many well-known features are reproduced here, such as the thin
  crust of the Basin and Range and the thick crust of the US Great Plains and
  Midcontinent. The map also reveals a number of new features. The thickest
  crust is beneath Late Proterozoic regions, not the oldest crust (e.g., Superior
  Province, central and eastern Canada). The map shows 40+ km thick crust beneath
  the US Cascades, while thin crust is imaged to the north beneath the Canadian
  Cordillera.</p>
<p>These features were only hinted at in previously published
  contour maps (Soller et al., 1982, and Allenby and Schnetzler, 1983). In addition,
  the extent of the continental shelves along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts
  are more faithfully reproduced in terms of crustal thickness. The average thickness
  of the North American continental crust, including margins, is 36.5 km ranges
  from 14 km to 60 km.</p>
<p>Figure 3 presents a map of sub-Moho p-wave
  velocity (Pn). The average crustal p-wave velocity (Pc) of North America including
  the sediments is shown in Figure 4. Figure
  5 presents the average p-wave velocity of the consolidated or crystalline
  crust (Pcc) without sediments in North America. </p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>
<p>A close correspondence exists between high average crustal
  velocity and accretionary and magmatic orogenies (e.g., Trans-Hudsonian, Grenvillian,
  Acadian, Appalachian, the Cascades, and the Alaskan Range). In contrast, there
  are a number of interesting anomalously low average crustal velocities in the
  Basin and Range Province, the Snake River Region, and the Northwest Territories
  of Canada. Many of these are regions of active or recent extension or hotspot
  activity.</p>
