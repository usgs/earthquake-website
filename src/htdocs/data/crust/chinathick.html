<p>Crustal thickness (km) obtained primarily from seismic
refraction/wide-angel reflection experiments. Thick crust is displayed
in green shades, and thin crust is displayed in pink shades. Solid
isolines represent more reliable results while dashed lines were obtained
considering gravity data. The 45 km contour coincides with the western
boundary of the Sino-Korean and Yangtze platforms as well as a north-south
trending seismic belt (105&deg; E).</p>
