<p>More than 36,000 km of Deep Seismic Sounding (DSS) profiles have
been acquired in China since 1958.
However, the results of these profiles are not well known in the West. Here, we
summarize the crustal structure of China with a new <a href="chinathick.html">contour
map</a> of crustal thickness, nine representative <a href="chinacolumns.html">crustal
columns</a>, and maps showing <a href="chinatectonics.html">profile
locations</a>, <a href="chinavel.html">average
crustal velocity, and Pn velocity</a>. The most remarkable aspect of the
crustal structure of China is the well known 70&plusmn;km thick crust of the Tibetan
Plateau. The average crustal velocity of China ranges from 6.15 to 6.45
km/s, indicating a felsic-to-intermediate bulk crustal composition. Upper
mantle (Pn) velocities are 8.0 &plusmn; 0.2 km/s, equal to the global continental average. </p>
<p>We
  interpret these results in terms of the most recent thermo-tectonic events that
  have modified the crust. In much of eastern China, Cenozoic crustal extension
  has produced a thin crust with a low average crustal velocity, similar to Western
  Europe and the Basin and Range Province, Western USA. In western China,
  Mesozoic and Cenozoic arc-continent and continent-continent collisions have
  led to crustal growth and thickening. A high velocity (7.0-7.4 km/s) lower
  crustal layer has been reported in western China only beneath the southernmost
  Tibetan Plateau. We identify this high velocity layer as the cold lower
  crust of the subducting Indian plate. As the Indian crust is injected
  northward into the Tibetan lower crust, it heats and assimilates by partial
  melting, a process that results in a reduction in the seismic velocity of the
  lower crust in the central and northern Tibetan Plateau.</p>

<h2>Deep Seismic Sounding (DSS) profile</h2>
<p>Western China is a showcase of complex geological and geophysical
  features, including sedimentary basins, regimes of continental collisional tectonics,
  and the thickest crust found on earth. To be able to accurately monitor western
  China for nuclear explosions we must first understand as much as possible about
  the crustal structure there. Here, we present results of a seismic refraction
  profile across western China (Wang et al., 2001). Seismic energy for this profile
  was provided by twelve chemical explosive shots fired in boreholes. The charge
  size ranged from 1500 to 4000 kg, sufficient to provide clear first arrivals
  to a maximum distance of 300 km. The distance between shotpoints ranged from
  63 to 205 km, and the interval between portable seismographs was between 2 and
  4 km. The profile was recorded along existing roads, and provided nearly straight
  profile segments. </p>

<p>During the experiments both P- and S-wave data were acquired,
  even for data recorded by single-component geophones. The reflection from the
  Moho was especially strong, and this made it possible for us to derive the crustal
  composition using the crustal Poisson&rsquo;s ratio or Vp/Vs ratio which could be
  obtained from the crustal P- and S-wave velocity structures. In the correlation
  of phases, reduction velocities of 6.0 km/s and 3.46 km/s were used for P- and
  S-waves, respectively. The time scales used for S-waves were multiplied by a
  factor of 0.58 in the S-wave record section so they would match the P-wave arrival
  times. Because digital filtering introduces a slight time shift, the unfiltered
  P-wave data was used for phase correlation and travel time picking. In order
  to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for phase correlation, the S-wave data
  was filtered with a bandpass of 0-6 Hz.  </p>
<p>Based on the phase correlation, the first arrivals of the P<sub>g</sub>
  phase were used to invert the upper crustal velocity structure using the finite-difference
  tomographic method of Hole (1992). The reflection phases were used to determine
  the one-dimensional crustal velocity structure using the X<sup>2</sup>-T<sup>2</sup>
  method (Giese, Prodehl and Stein, 1976) and the Reflectivity method (Fuchs and
  Muller, 1971). With one-dimensional crustal velocity structures from each shotpoint,
  a crustal P-wave velocity structure was established using a 2-D dynamic raytracing
  program to model both kinetic and dynamic features of the observed seismic wave
  field (Cerveny, Molotkov, and Psencik, 1977; Cerveny and Psencik, 1984). The
  different phases on the record sections were all appropriately fitted for travel
  times and amplitudes.</p>

<p>The transect shows three-layer stratification
  with P-wave velocities of 6.0-6.3 km/s, 6.3-6.6 km/s, and 6.9-7.0 km/s. Upper
  mantle (Pn) velocities of 7.7-7.8 km/s were found.</p>
<p>The accuracy of the final model is dependent on a number of
  factors, including the shotpoint interval, receiver density, and thickness of
  sediments in the shallow crust. Model accuracy primarily depends on the correct
  identification of the various phases and the density of rays penetrating a particular
  volume of the model, however. Perturbation of the models has shown that, depending
  on the uniformity of structure and the density of rays, the resolution of velocity
  and depth to interface may be accepted as better than 2% and 5%, respectively.
  By the relationship between the Poisson&rsquo;s ratio and the Vp/Vs ratio, the Poisson&rsquo;s
  ratio is determined to within an uncertainty of less than 2%.</p>
