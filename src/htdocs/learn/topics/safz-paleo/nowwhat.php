<h2>Now What?</h2>
<p>
  The paleoseismic data on different parts of the San Andreas Fault Zone are all telling us that various sections appear to be due or overdue for a significant earthquake.  But the data can’t predict: it won’t tell us exactly where the next earthquake will be, what the magnitude will be, or exactly when it will happen.  Let’s imagine for a minute that we know where, how large, and when.  You might think that would be good because then you could leave the area beforehand and then return after the earthquake.  But focusing only on avoiding an earthquake doesn’t address most of the effects from the shaking.  As you returned to your home, you would probably see damaged and collapsed buildings and bridges, broken pipes and snapped power lines, and blackened remains of fires.  Upon entering your house, you would stumble over toppled bookcases, broken glass from mirrors no longer on the walls, and the contents of kitchen cabinets in piles on the floor.

  It would be good to know exactly when, where, and how large the next earthquake will be, and scientists are working to improve the forecasts. Using the forecasts, we can properly engineer structures, plan for earthquake response, and be prepared at home to make a big difference in the impact of a significant earthquake.
