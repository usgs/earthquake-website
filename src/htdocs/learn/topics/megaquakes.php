  Throughout the history of Hollywood, disaster films have been sure-fire
  winners for moviemakers. Beginning with &#8220;The Wind&#8221; in 1928,
  Americans have been plagued by a &#8220;Twister&#8221; and &#8220;The
  Perfect Storm&#8221;. We&#8217;ve survived &#8220;Volcano&#8221; and
  &#8220;Earthquake&#8221; and &#8220;The Swarm&#8221; all followed by
  &#8220;Armageddon&#8221;. That&#8217;s not even mentioning us getting
  through &#8220;The Towering Inferno&#8221; and finally making it to &#8220;
  The Day After Tomorrow&#8221;.

<p>
  With amazing special effects, it&#8217;s easy to get caught up in the fantasy
  disaster epic, but <strong>Hollywood fantasy is not California reality</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/">U.S. Geological Survey</a> is the lead
  federal agency responsible for researching, monitoring and forecasting
  geologic hazards such as earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides. And we have
  the further responsibility to educate Americans about the real hazards they
  face and to separate science fact from science fantasy.
</p>
<h3> Here is some science-based information on earthquakes.</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Big earthquakes are naturally occurring events well outside the
  powers of humans to create or stop.</strong> An earthquake is caused by a
  sudden slip on a fault, much like what happens when you snap your fingers.
  Before the snap, you push your fingers together and sideways. Because you are
  pushing them together, friction keeps them from slipping. When you apply
  enough stress to overcome this friction, your fingers move suddenly,
  releasing energy. The same &#8220;stick-slip&#8221; process goes on in the
  earth. Stresses in the earth's outer layer push the side of the fault
  together. The friction across the surface of the fault holds the rocks
  together so they do not slip immediately when pushed sideways. Eventually
  enough stress builds up and the rocks slip suddenly, releasing energy in
  waves that travel through the rock to cause the shaking that we feel during
  an earthquake.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike finger-snaps, <strong>earthquakes typically originate several to tens
  of miles below the surface of the Earth</strong>. It takes many years
  &#8211; decades to centuries &#8211; to build up enough stress to make a
  large earthquake, and the fault may be tens to hundreds of miles long. The
  scale and force necessary to produce earthquakes are well beyond our daily
  lives. Likewise, people cannot prevent earthquakes from happening or stop
  them once they&#8217;ve started &#8211; giant nuclear explosions at shallow
  depths, like those in some movies, won&#8217;t actually stop an earthquake.

  It&#8217;s well known that California, the Pacific Northwest and Alaska all
  have frequent earthquakes, some of which are quite damaging. Some areas of
  the country are more at risk than others, but, in fact, <strong>42 of the 50 states could experience damaging ground shaking</strong> from an earthquake in 50 years (which is the typical lifetime of a building), and 16 states have a relatively high likelihood of experiencing damaging ground shaking. A 2014 map of seismic hazards in the United States is shown (left), <a href="/hazards/products/conterminous/2014/HazardMap2014_lg.jpg"
  >A larger hi-res version of the 2014 US Hazard Map can be found here</a>.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>The two most important variables affecting earthquake damage are the
  intensity of ground shaking caused by the quake and the quality of the
  engineering of structures in the region.</strong> The level of shaking, in
  turn, is controlled by the proximity of the earthquake source to the affected
  region and the types of rocks that seismic waves pass through en route
  (particularly those at or near the ground surface). Generally, the bigger and
  closer the earthquake, the stronger the shaking. But there have been large
  earthquakes with very little damage either because they caused little shaking
  or because the buildings were built to withstand that shaking. In other
  cases, moderate earthquakes have caused significant damage either because
  the shaking was locally amplified, or more likely because the structures were
  poorly engineered.
</p>
<p>
  People can&#8217;t stop earthquakes from happening. People can
  significantly mitigate their effects by identifying hazards, building safer
  structures, and learning about earthquake safety. There are simple actions we all should take to get prepared to survive and recover - <strong>visit <a href="http://earthquakecountry.org/sevensteps/">Seven Steps to Earthquake Safety</a> (Earthquake Country Alliance) to learn more.</strong>
</p>
  The idea of a &#8220;Mega-Quake&#8221; &#8211; an earthquake of magnitude 10
  or larger &#8211; while theoretically possible&#8212;is very highly unlikely.
  Earthquake magnitude is based in part on the length of faults -- the longer
  the fault, the larger the earthquake. <strong>The simple truth is that there
  are no known faults capable of generating a magnitude 10 or larger
  &#8220;mega-quake.&#8221;</strong>  The San Andreas fault is not long and deep enough to have a magnitude 9 or larger earthquake as depicted in the movie.  The largest historical earthquake on the northern San Andreas was the 1906 magnitude 7.9 earthquake. In 1857 the Fort Tejon earthquake occurred on the southern San Andreas fault; it is believed to have had a magnitude of about 7.9 as well.   Computer models show that the San Andreas fault is capable of producing earthquakes up to about magnitude 8.3, but anything larger is extremely unlikely.  Shaking from even the largest possible San Andreas fault events will not be felt on the east coast.

<p>
  So when you see the next big disaster film, rest assured that movies are just
  entertainment. Enjoy them! And then go learn about the real-world science
  behind disasters and if you live in an area where hazards exist, take the
  suggested steps to protect you and your family.
