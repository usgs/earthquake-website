This implies a recurrence interval of about 500 years.</dd>  <dt>Given this and other new information, can one estimate the probability of damaging earthquakes in the New Madrid seismic zone?</dt>  <dd>		<p>			We have learned a tremendous amount about the New Madrid seismic zone since 1985. One of the things we have learned is that coming up with probabilities is much more difficult than we used to think. If we use the data on historical seismicity combined with the new information on recurrence of large earthquakes, and make the same assumptions that go into the National Seismic Hazard maps, we would estimate a 25-40% chance of a magnitude 6.0 and greater earthquake in the next 50 years and about a 7-10% probability of a repeat of the 1811-1812 earthquakes in the same time period.		</p>  	<p>			However, it is VERY important to note that these estimates alone do not include information about WHERE the earthquakes might occur and therefore what shaking might affect any given location.  More useful are the estimates of the likely amount of ground shaking that can be expected, contained in the National Seismic Hazard maps.  The ground shaking estimated accounts for both the likely ranges of recurrence intervals and locations.		</p>	</dd>  <dt>Does everyone within USGS agree on the cause and effects of a future New Madrid earthquake?</dt>  <dd>		<p>			No one knows what causes New Madrid earthquakes.  However, there are ideas that are being researched.   Although there is great uncertainty regarding the cause of earthquakes, scientists generally do agree on what happens when they do occur,  that is, the likely levels of ground shaking associated with the waves earthquakes emit.  These levels are reflected in the National Seismic Hazard Maps, which represent the products of a long consensus building process.  These maps also account for the uncertainties in our understanding.		</p>  	<p>			Differences of opinion within the research community invariably will arise.  Generally these are not critical to people outside the research arena.  When they are, the USGS sometimes has held workshops to try to come to a consensus and at other times has announced our own internal consensus.  Generally, we have met with the CUSEC State Geologists and been able to come to agreement at least between the State Surveys and the USGS, as well as many other scientists.  In most situations, the State Surveys are the ones responsible to the State Governors and the USGS works closely with them.		</p>	</dd>  <dt>What is the potential for a large New Madrid earthquake triggering an earthquake in the Wabash Valley?</dt>  <dd>All we know is that this has not happened in the past few 1811-1812-sized New Madrid earthquake sequences.</dd>  <dt>After a major earthquake in the New Madrid or Wabash Valley seismic zone, what changes to the landscape would we most likely see?</dt>  <dd>Deformation of the land surface directly over a fault that moves may manifest as very localized uplift or subsidence, or lateral distortions of up to several meters (for a very large earthquake).  Shaking can cause ground failure of various types, including liquefaction and landsliding. These would have significant effect on the landscape in terms of damming streams, spewing sand and mud into fields, and causing areas near bluffs and rivers to slide and form a broken up surface.</dd>  <dt>Can you explain liquefaction? What conditions would increase or decrease the amount of liquefaction?</dt>  <dd>Liquefaction occurs when loose, sandy, water saturated soils are strongly shaken. The soils lose their capacity to bear any weight and can flow like a liquid.  This process is accompanied by high pore water pressures that can force sand, water, and mud upward, often forming the signature sand blows of the New Madrid seismic zone. Many factors affect how susceptible materials are to liquefaction, but some of the most important requirements are the degree of water saturation, the size of the grains, and how well cemented they are.</dd>  <dt>After the 1811/1812 earthquakes there were reports that the Mississippi River flowed backward. Can you explain this phenomenon and what is it called?</dt>  <dd>One of the 1812 earthquakes occurred on a fault that actually crossed the river three times.  The uplift along this fault formed a scarp or cliff that caused both a dam and waterfalls at different locations.  The damming of the river would have temporarily backed the river up, which may account for the descriptions of the river boat pilots.</dd></dl>
