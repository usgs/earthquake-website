	Earthquakes can occur anywhere between the
	Earth's surface and about 700 kilometers below the
	surface. For scientific purposes, this earthquake depth
	range of 0 - 700 km is divided into three zones: shallow,
	intermediate, and deep.
</p>
<p>
	Shallow earthquakes are between 0 and 70 km deep;
	intermediate earthquakes, 70 - 300 km deep; and deep
	earthquakes, 300 - 700 km deep. In general, the term "deep-focus
	earthquakes" is applied to earthquakes
	deeper than 70 km. All earthquakes deeper than 70 km
	are localized within great slabs of shallow lithosphere
	that are sinking into the Earth's mantle.
</p>
<p>
	The evidence for deep-focus earthquakes was
	discovered in 1922 by H.H. Turner of Oxford,
	England. Previously, all earthquakes were considered
	to have shallow focal depths. The existence of deep-focus
	earthquakes was confirmed in 1931 from studies
	of the seismograms of several earthquakes, which in
	turn led to the construction of travel-time curves for
	intermediate and deep earthquakes.
</p>
<p>
	The most obvious indication on a seismogram that a
	large earthquake has a deep focus is the small amplitude,
	or height, of the recorded surface waves and the uncomplicated
	character of the P and S waves. Although
	the surface-wave pattern does generally indicate
	that an earthquake is either shallow or may have
	some depth, the most accurate method of determining
	the focal depth of an earthquake is to read a depth
	phase recorded on the seismogram. The depth phase is
	the characteristic phase pP-a P wave reflected from
	the surface of the Earth at a point relatively near the
	hypocenter. At distant seismograph stations, the pP follows the P
	wave by a time interval that changes slowly with
	distance but rapidly with depth. This time interval,
	pP-P (pP minus P), is used to compute depth-of-focus
	tables. Using the time difference of pP-P as read from the
	seismogram and the distance between the
	epicenter and the seismograph station, the depth of
	the earthquake can be determined from published
	travel-time curves or depth tables.
</p>
<p>
	Another seismic wave used to determine focal depth
	is the sP phase - an S wave reflected as a P wave from
	the Earth's surface at a point near the epicenter. This
	wave is recorded after the pP by about one-half of the
	pP-P time interval. The depth of an earthquake can be
	determined from the sP phase in the same manner as
	the pP phase by using the appropriate travel-time
	curves or depth tables for sP.
</p>
<p>
	If the pP and sP waves can be identified on the
	seismogram, an accurate focal depth can be determined.
