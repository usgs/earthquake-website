  Seismic waves have <strong>two main types of effects</strong> on groundwater levels:
  <strong>oscillations</strong>, and <strong>&quot;permanent&quot; offsets</strong>. Muddy or turbid water at long distances from the
  epicenter are most likely  an aftereffect of oscillations.
</p>
<h2>Oscillations</h2>
<p>
  Oscillations have been known for decades (see papers by Rexin below).
  The oscillations are rarely recorded with a short enough sampling period
  to see details of the wave train. On chart recorders they show up as
  vertical lines and on digital data sampled every few minutes they show up
  as a few errant data points. When they are recorded with a sampling interval
  of about 1 sec, they generally look like low-pass-filtered seismograms. Dominant
  periods are about 20 sec, consistent with the idea that the water level changes
  are predominantly caused by long-period surface waves.
</p>
<p>
  A <strong>theory</strong> for the oscillations was developed by <cite>Cooper et al.</cite> and refined by <cite>Liu et al.</cite> This theory is based on the idea that seismic waves cause
  expansion and contraction of the aquifer tapped by the well, in turn causing oscillatory
  pore pressure changes. If the aquifer has high enough transmissivity, then
  these pressure changes cause flow into and out of the well. The flow in turn
  sets up resonant motion of the water column. For most well-aquifer systems,
  the theoretical dominant frequency is around 10-30 sec based on the height of
  the water column. Following this theory, the head changes in the aquifer
  induced by the seismic waves are actually only a fraction of the water-level changes in the
  well.
</p>
<p>
  The theory is only now being rigourously tested by quantitatively comparing
  seismograms with the &quot;hydroseismograms&quot;, and so far the  conclusion is that the resonance
  effect is not actually that important. This implies that
  the pore pressure changes in the aquifer are about the same size as the water level
  fluctuations in the well. If this holds true for additional sites, it means that seismic waves
  induce bigger pore pressure changes in subsurface formations than previously thought.
</p>
<h2>Offsets</h2>
<p>
  The &quot;offsets&quot; are harder to explain. They have also been known for
  decades (eg., the 1964 Alaska quake papers). We do expect offsets in the
  &quot;near field&quot; of an earthquake because the fault offset produces permanent expansion and
  contraction of the surrounding rocks. At distances of 100's or 1000's of km, however,
  the permanent ground deformation is negligible.
</p>
<h3>Some observations about the steps:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Certain wells exhibit the offsets; most do not.</li>
  <li>At wells that respond this way, the offsets are always in the same direction; that can be either up or down.</li>
  <li>In hot-water wells, the offsets are frequently rises.</li>
  <li>The largest offset  recorded digitally is a 1-m rise caused by the 1989 Loma Prieta
    earthquake in the BV well at Parkfield (see <cite>Roeloffs, 1998</cite>).</li>
  <li>The offsets can be &quot;instantaneous&quot; (to the resolution of the water level
    sampling interval), or they can begin abruptly and take days to weeks to reach their
    maximun (or minimum) values. The slower responses generally follow curves that are
    well-matched by a 1-D groundwater diffusion model, ie., the shapes of these curves
    suggest that seismic waves change water level &quot;instantaneously&quot; at a location near, but
    not at, the well.</li>
  <li>The offsets are not limited to shallow depth. The deepest recorded one  was probably the response of the Long Valley Exploratory well to the Oct 16, 1999
    Hector Mine earthquake (about 400 km away). Fluid in the this well is in communication with
    a transmissive fracture at a depth of 2.6 km.</li>
  <li>For each well exhibiting offsets there is usually a magnitude-distance
    threshold that will predict whether or not an offset will be observed. For example,
    a M5 event 20 km away might produce a step; if the event is 400 km distant it would
    need to be a M7.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some possible mechanisms for the steps</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For upward steps in shallow wells, compaction of overlying alluvium such as
    occurs during liquefaction is a possibility (<cite>Roeloffs, 1998</cite>)</li>
  <li>Escape of small amounts of exolved gas from pore space could cause fluid
    pressure drops (<cite>Matsumoto and Roeloffs</cite>)</li>
  <li>A change of permeability due to unclogging of a fracture by flow induced by
    seismic waves (<cite>Brodsky et al.</cite>)</li>
  <li>At Long Valley, incremental amounts of dome inflation triggered by seismic
    waves (<cite>Roeloffs et al.</cite>)</li>
  <li>In hot water wells at Long Valley, thermal pressurization due to upward
    movement of hot fluid triggered by seismic waves (Roeloffs et al., submitted).
    Scientific importance of all this:
    From my viewpoint, the most important scientific implications have to do with
    the remote triggering of seismicity (and possibly volcanic eruptions) by large
    earthquakes. Seismic waves at distant locations are transient, yet they can
    trigger seismicity that persists for days (or longer) or larger events
    that are delayed.
    It is known that increasing fluid pressure can trigger earthquakes (lab and
    induced seismicity studies), and the seismic-wave-induced fluid pressure offsets
    are effects that last much longer than the duration of the seismic wave train. It also
    appears that triggered seismicity preferentially occurs in hydrothermal areas, and
    that in these areas fluid pressure rises are more likely to be increases. The
    exact mechanism linking the fluid pressure changes and triggered earthquakes isn't yet
    pinned down, but the circumstantial evidence for a connection is rather compelling.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Further Details </h2>
<p>
  Confined vs. unconfined aquifers: In the &quot;near field&quot; of an earthquake
  (say 10-20 km), confined aquifers are more likely to show a response to
  permanent deformation caused by the fault offset. However, seismic waves
  seem to be able to cause groundwater level changes in other ways, and these
  changes can show up in either confined or unconfined aquifers.
</p>
<p>
  Changes caused by permanent deformation
  (strain) only last until the pressure equilibrates with the water table. This can
  happen in minutes or may take months. The time scale is approximately given by the
  square of the aquifer depth divided by the vertical hydraulic diffusivity
  of the overlying material. This is only relevant in the near field of the
  earthquake. Other step-like changes tend to recover on the order of weeks or months.
  The mechanisms of most of these changes are unknown, so the mechanism of their recovery is
  unknown. The recovery may take place by flow to the boundaries of the
  hydrologic system, so the time scale is governed by the distance to the boundaries and the
  hydraulic diffusivity.
</p>
<p>
  Could water levels be affected several times per year? If a well
  exhibits seismic oscillations, then it could potentially have oscillations for many
  earthquakes of M7 occurring within a distance of 3000-4000 km. However, the water level
  usually comes back to the pre-earthquake value within minutes or tens of minutes after
  the earthquake, so this should not pose a problem in a remediation scheme.
  Wells that exhibit &quot;long-term&quot; offsets tend to do so for larger, nearer
  earthquakes. So such a well could be affected several times a year if it's in a
  seismically active area.
</p>
<p>
  When an earthquake in Alaska changes water levels in the midwest US, for example, producing
  a &quot;step-like&quot; change, we don't really know the reason. So, we also don't
  know how the aquifer pressures are affected away from the wells, and we don't know the
  types of flow that would be set up by these effects.
