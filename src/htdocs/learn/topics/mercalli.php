<p>
The effect of an earthquake on the Earth's
surface is called the intensity. The intensity
scale consists of a series of certain key
responses such as people awakening, movement
of furniture, damage to chimneys, and
finally - total destruction. Although numerous
<i> intensity scales</i> have been developed over
the last several hundred years to evaluate
the effects of earthquakes, the one currently
used in the United States is the Modified
Mercalli (MM) Intensity Scale. It was developed
in 1931 by the American seismologists
Harry Wood and Frank Neumann. This scale,
composed of increasing levels of intensity
that range from imperceptible shaking to
catastrophic destruction, is designated by
Roman numerals. It does not have a mathematical
basis; instead it is an arbitrary
ranking based on observed effects.
</p>
<p>
The Modified Mercalli Intensity value
assigned to a specific site after an earthquake
has a more meaningful measure of
severity to the nonscientist than the magnitude
because intensity refers to the effects
actually experienced at that place.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>lower</strong> numbers of the intensity scale
generally deal with the manner in which the
earthquake is felt by people. The <b>higher</b>
numbers of the scale are based on observed
structural damage. Structural engineers
usually contribute information for assigning
intensity values of VIII or above.
</p>
<p>
The following is an abbreviated description of
the levels of Modified Mercalli intensity.

			<td>Weak</td>
			<td>Felt quite noticeably by persons indoors,

					Many people do not recognize it as an
					earthquake. Standing motor cars may
					rock slightly.  Vibrations similar to the
					passing of a truck. Duration estimated.</td>

			<td style="background-color:#7efbdf;">IV</td>
			<td>Light</td>
			<td>Felt indoors by many, outdoors by few
					during the day. At night, some awakened.
					Dishes, windows, doors disturbed; walls
					make cracking sound. Sensation like
					heavy truck striking building. Standing
					motor cars rocked noticeably.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="background-color:#95f879;">V</td>
			<td>Moderate</td>
			<td>Felt by nearly everyone; many awakened.
					Some dishes, windows broken. Unstable
					objects overturned. Pendulum clocks
					may stop.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="background-color:#f7f835;">VI</td>
			<td>Strong</td>
			<td>Felt by all, many frightened. Some heavy
					furniture moved; a few instances of fallen
					plaster. Damage slight.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="background-color:#fdca2c;">VII</td>
			<td>Very strong</td>
			<td>Damage negligible in buildings of good
					design and construction; slight to moderate
					in well-built ordinary structures;
					considerable damage in poorly built or
					badly designed structures; some
					chimneys broken.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="background-color:#ff701f;">VIII</td>
			<td>Severe</td>
			<td>Damage slight in specially designed
					structures; considerable damage in
					ordinary substantial buildings with
					partial collapse. Damage great in poorly built
					structures. Fall of chimneys, factory
					stacks, columns, monuments, walls.
					Heavy furniture overturned.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="background-color:#ec2516;">IX</td>
			<td>Violent</td>
			<td>Damage considerable in specially designed
					structures; well-designed frame
					structures thrown out of plumb. Damage
					great in substantial buildings, with partial
					collapse. Buildings shifted off foundations.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td style="background-color:#c81e11;">X</td>
			<td>Extreme</td>
			<td>Some well-built wooden structures
					destroyed; most masonry and frame
					structures destroyed with foundations.
					Rails bent.</td>
