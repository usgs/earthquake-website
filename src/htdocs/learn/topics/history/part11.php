	<h3>The Tilt Controversy</h3>

	<p>
		For a seismograph to be effective, its response characteristics
		must be known. We have seen that the British seismologists in Japan
		attempted to simplify the problem of the seismograph response by
		building relatively long-period instruments, and assuming that the
		seismogram trace was proportional to the ground displacement.
		The general problem of the response of a damped oscillatory system
		to ground motion of arbitrary period was considered theoretically
		by Perry and Ayrton (1879). Poincar&#233; (1888) and Lippmann (1890)
		presented short notes on the integration of a seismogram trace
		to obtain ground displacement.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the 1890's, however, the possibility arose that all of the
		theories of seismograph response just mentioned were fundamentally
		wrong. For these theories assumed that a seismograph pendulum
		responds to linear motion which is in the plane of oscillation of
		the pendulum and perpendicular to the line joining the pendulum's
		center-of-mass with the pendulum's axis-of-rotation. That is,
		a common pendulum which oscillated in an east-west plane was
		expected to respond to linear horizontal motions occurring in the
		east-west plane. The alternative theory, which became very
		widespread in the 1890's, was that horizontal and common pendulums
		were responding largely to tilting, which was in turn due to
		vertical displacements of the Earth's surface. As the Earth's
		surface tilted up and down, the pendulum would attempt always to
		point in the direction of gravity (or to point along the projection
		on the pendulum's plane-of-oscillation
		of the direction of gravity).
	</p>
	<p>
		At first, the implications of recording tilting instead of
		displacements do not seem to have been understood among seismologists
		in Europe. We shall see, however, that calculated ground displacements
		commonly varied by several orders of magnitude according as the
		seismograph was assumed to be responding to horizontal displacements
		or to tilts due to vertical displacements. To be confident of any
		seismographic measurements of the amplitude of ground motion in an
		earthquake, it was necessary to determine the importance of tilting
		in earthquake motion.
	</p>
	<p>
		An instrument for recording tilt in an earthquake was suggested as
		early as 1703 (De la Haute Feuille, 1703), but the idea that
		seismographs should record tilting in earthquakes was not widely
		accepted until European seismologists began recording teleseisms.
		Then, it was assumed without much argument, at first, that the
		recorded waves represented tilt, rather than horizontal motions
		(Ehlert, 1897a; Schl&#252;ter, 1903, p. 301-325). Perhaps this was
		because the earliest records of a teleseism, those of von Rebeur,
		were obtained with instruments which were built to measure changes
		in the direction of the vertical. Furthermore, the recorded motion,
		consisting of long-period sinusoidal oscillations, suggested a
		wave motion not unlike waves on the surface of the sea, which
		seemed to imply considerable tilting (Agamennone, 1894).
	</p>
	<p>
		While the European seismologists were interpreting their first
		seismograms of teleseisms, John Milne, still in Japan, had
		independently concluded that tilting had a significant effect on
		the response of a seismograph in an earthquake. During the Mino-Owari
		earthquake of October 28, 1891, Milne (1893d) had observed
		horizontal-pendulum seismometers located at a distance of
		140 miles from the epicenter and was convinced from watching the
		pendulums that the instruments were being tilted. A comparison
		of seismograms from different horizontal instruments suggested
		that record amplitudes were proportional to the static tilt
		sensitivities of the instruments
		rather than to their static displacement sensitivities.
		In order to obtain a more accurate measure of tilt, Milne (1893e)
		set up a beam balance, arranged so that the motion of the balance's
		vertical pointer was amplified and recorded on a smoked-glass plate.
		Milne believed that the beam would remain horizontal in an
		earthquake while the Earth tilted beneath it. The balance was in
		stable equilibrium, so that one would expect it to respond also to
		horizontal displacements of the ground, like any other pendulum.
		Nevertheless, Milne seemed to assume that the records given by
		the instrument represented only tilt. Significant "tilting" was
		recorded by the balance seismograph. Milne was forced to the
		"unpleasant conclusion ... that all the records hitherto published in
		Japan where vertical motion has been recorded are of but little
		value" (Milne, 1893e, p. 103-104).

		Soon, however, the "tilting hypothesis" met objections. A major
		difficulty was the large vertical displacement required to produce
		a tilting of the magnitude which seismologists believed they were
		recording. Under the assumption that his seismographs
		were recording only tilt, Cancani (1894) calculated that the
		ground rose and fell forty centimeters during the passage of waves
		of sixteen-second period from a distant earthquake. The improbability
		of such large vertical motion occurring in the unfelt waves of a
		distant earthquake was emphasized by Schmidt (1896). The same
		record which Cancani thought represented tilting due to a vertical
		displacement of forty centimeters, Schmidt pointed out, could also
		represent a horizontal displacement of much smaller amplitude.
		(In this case, using Schmidt's formulas, the horizontal amplitude
		would be less than a millimeter.) Feeling that a horizontal
		displacement of a millimeter was more probable than a vertical
		displacement of forty centimeters, Schmidt concluded that the
		common and horizontal pendulums were indeed recording horizontal
		oscillations from teleseisms.
	</p>
	<p>
		Schmidt's conclusion was not accepted by many seismologists,
		at first, and a controversy arose over the presence or absence of
		large tilts in earthquake waves. (Ehlert (1897a) summarizes the
		arguments which were used "for" and "against" tilting.) Although
		the large vertical displacements required to produce significant
		tilting were not perceptible to human beings, Ehlert (1897a) argued
		that the vertical displacements might still exist, but that
		their periods were too long to be noticed by humans. At this time,
		there were no long period vertical seismographs, and seismologists
		do not seem to have considered the possibilities of directly
		recording the vertical displacements believed to be responsible
		for tilting.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1899, W. Schl&#252;ter (1903) began recording in G&#246;ttingen with a
		tilt-measuring
		device, which he called a "klinograph". The instrument was
		similar to a beam balance,
		with the difference that the horizontal axis of rotation of the
		moving frame, or beam, passed through the center of mass of the frame
		(Figure 25). In this situation, the frame would not respond to linear
		displacements. By virtue of its rotational inertia, however, the
		frame would respond to a rotational motion in a vertical plane,
		i.e., tilting. In order to stabilize the klinograph, Schl&#252;ter adding
		a restoring force to one end of the beam. The instrument recorded
		photographically.
	</p>
	<p>
		Schl&#252;ter operated his klinograph simultaneously with a horizontal
		pendulum seismograph. He calculated the tilt sensitivities of the
		two instruments and found them
		to be of the same order of magnitude. If an earthquake were
		recorded on the horizontal pendulum seismograph, and if the
		seismogram from this instrument represented tilting of the ground,
		then the earthquake would be well recorded on the klinograph.
		Contrary to what he had expected, Schl&#252;ter found that the
		klinograph recorded nothing at times when the horizontal pendulum
		seismograph recorded large earthquakes. He concluded that the
		horizontal pendulum was responding only to horizontal displacements,
		for which the klinograph had no sensitivity. Tilting, if it existed,
		was too small to affect either his klinograph or contemporary
		horizontal pendulum seismometers.
	</p>
	<p>
		Schl&#252;ter's experiment, and theoretical considerations such as those
		of Schmidt, were accepted by many as strong evidence in favor of the
		viewpoint that seismographs
		responded largely to linear motion rather than tilting,
		except for waves of
		very long period (Wiechert, 1903). The experiment provided
		justification for neglecting the effect of tilt in theoretical
		studies of seismograph response. Those (such as Galitzin, 1902)
		who doubted the validity of Schl&#252;ter's experiment found the theory
		of a pendulum responding to both tilt and displacements to be so
		complicated that they were forced to neglect the effect of tilt
		as a matter of convenience (Galitzin, 1904).

		remembers when Father Macelwane changed the interpretation charts
		for the Berkeley Bosch-Omori pendulums to correspond to response
		to tilt rather than displacement. This was in 1923.]
