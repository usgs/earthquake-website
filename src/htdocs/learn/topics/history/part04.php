	<h3>Seismoscopes in Eighteenth Century Europe</h3>

	<p>
		We find Europeans writing on earthquake-detecting instruments
		from the early eighteenth century. In 1703, J. de la Haute Feuille
		proposed filling a bowl to the brim
		with mercury, so that an earthquake would cause some of the
		mercury to spill out
		(de la Haute Feuille, 1703; Favaro, 1884). In order to
		determine the direction of the shock,
		the mercury spilling out in each of the eight principal directions
		of the compass was to be collected in cavities or other containers.
		In an earthquake, de la Haute Feuille
		assumed, the ground would be inclined, and the direction in which
		the mercury spilled
		would be away from the origin, "where the ground began to be
		raised" (Favaro, 1884, p. 95). It is interesting that this
		earliest of European instruments was expected to
		respond to tilting of the Earth's surface rather than to horizontal
		displacements. An indication of the distance of the epicenter
		and the size of the disturbance could be had from the amount
		of mercury which had sloshed out.
	</p>
	<p>
		An important function of de la Haute Feuille's instrument
		was to provide data from which future earthquakes might be predicted.
		His proposed method of earthquake prediction was
		to use his instrument to record the small shocks which he supposed
		must precede a large earthquake. Each day, an observer would note
		the amount of mercury spilled out of the bowl, if any had been
		spilled. If a large amount of mercury
		spilled out, a large earthquake would probably be imminent.
		With a large
		body of observations, patterns might be detected which would
		enable the prediction of future earthquakes.
		De la Haute Feuille seemed to believe that earthquakes were
		caused by the explosion of
		sulphurous matter and various salts within the Earth. Davison
		(1927) has indicated that this idea was widespread
		in de la Haute Feuille's time.
	</p>
	<p>
		De La Haute Feuille clearly understood that instruments would
		make an important contribution to seismology. He emphasized
		the need for large numbers of instrumental
		observations in order to learn about earthquakes. Nevertheless,
		there is no evidence that his seismoscope was ever built. De la
		Haute Feuille's suggestion seems to have
		had little influence on the development of seismometers.
		A closely similar instrument
		was built in 1784 by A. Cavalli, probably without knowledge
		of de la Haute Feuille's writing (Baratta, 1895, p. 8).
	</p>
	<p>
		The honor of being the first European to record the use of a
		mechanical device as an aid to the study of earthquakes goes to
		Nicholas Cirillo (1747). Cirillo employed
		simple pendulums in an investigation of a series of earthquakes in
		Naples in 1731. He observed
		the amplitude of pendulum oscillations at the locations
		where the shaking was most
		severe, and also at locations somewhat removed from the zone
		of severest shaking. He found the amplitude to decrease with
		the inverse square of the distance, a result he
		anticipated from "the common laws in other sorts of
		motions" (Cirillo, 1747, p. 682).
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1751, Andrea Bina proposed suspending a common
		pendulum, with a pointer attached to its lower end,
		above a tray of fine sand (Bina, 1751). The relative
		motion of
		the pendulum bob and the Earth was to be traced in the sand
		by the pointer. Bina seems to have built his instrument,
		but we do not know if an earthquake was ever recorded
		with the device. Bina's instrument was intended to tell the
		observer the character of the ground motion.
		The nature of the record traced in the sand would reveal
		whether the earthquake motion was "regular or swaying ...,
		tremulous or irregular..." (Bina, 1751, p.46).
	</p>
	<p>
		The construction of instruments in eighteenth-century Italy
		frequently coincided with periods of unusually high
		local seismic activity. The
		Calabrian earthquakes of 1783 were responsible for the greatest
		surge of interest. Davison (1936) lists six "principal"
		earthquakes in this series of shocks. Loss of life
		and property was enormous. The earthquakes were
		the subject of several detailed investigations,
		including a study by the first appointed "Earthquake Commission"
		(Davison, 1927, p. 29). The use of
		mechanical devices to verify the occurrence of
		earthquakes seems to have been natural
		to people living in areas affected by these shocks. Salfi (1787, p. 46)
		reported that the general populace used liquid-filled bowls and delicately-balanced objects
		as seismoscopes.
	</p>
	<p>
		The shocks also spurred the invention of more elaborate
		instruments. The most complete treatment of these
		instruments is given by Baratta (1895), who reproduces
		important sections of the original papers. Lacking some of
		the original papers, we have relied heavily on Baratta's study and the
		portions of the originals reproduced therein.
	</p>
	<p>
		D. Domemico Salsano, a clock-maker and mechanic of Naples,
		invented a "geo-sismometro" in February, 1783 (Salsano, 1783). It was
		operating shortly  after the first
		large Calabrian earthquake. It was a common pendulum, eight and
		a half "parisian" feet long. The pendulum mass was equipped with a brush,
		which was to record the motion of the mass with
		slow-drying ink on an ivory slab.
	</p>
	<p>
		Reports of the observations made by Salsano (Salsano, 1783; Torcia,
		1784) suggest that his pendulum may have responded to some
		of the earthquakes in Calabria, about
		two hundred miles away. The nature of the recorded observations
		suggests that many motions of the pendulum were not due to
		earthquakes, as might be expected for a
		pendulum in an unsheltered location. Nevertheless, sometimes
		the pendulum motions were roughly
		contemporaneous with earthquakes in Calabria.
		We are not told how exactly the pendulum motion
		and the earthquakes coincided in time. It is clear also from
		the description of observations that most, it not all, of
		these observations were made by watching the pendulum, rather
		than by examing records written by the pendulum.
		The pendulum was arranged to ring a bell when its oscillations
		were large enough. This it did on several occasions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Salsano's seismoscope received relatively little mention
		in the large studies of the Calabrian earthquakes.
		Baratta notes that some who did refer to the machine treated
		it with scorn. One writer, F. Salfi, pointed out that the
		instrument was nothing more
		than an ordinary pendulum, and criticized those who would
		"push to the foot of the throne" the merits of its inventor
		(Salfi, 1787, p. 46). Salfi's statement, however, hints
		that Salsano's instrument was well known in its time,
		in spite of the lack of printed recognition. Later, during
		the New Madrid earthquakes of 1811 and 1812 in
		America, Daniel Drake of Cincinnatti reported the used of an
		"instrument constructed on the principle of that
		used in Naples, at the time of the memorable
		Calabrian earthquake" which reportedly "marked the
		direction of undulation from south-southwest to
		north-northeast" (Fuller, 1912, p.27). Baratta (1895) also
		mentions a common pendulum constructed by Zupo, which wrote
		in sand. Perhaps this was the Neapolitan instrument
		to which Drake referred.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the years immediately following the Calabrian earthquakes,
		two other seismic instruments were described which should
		be mentioned here.
		A. Cavalli, in 1784, reinvented de la Haute Feuille's
		mercury-filled-bowl
		seismoscope (Cavalli, 1785). In addition, he designed a
		modification of this instrument which would give the time
		of an earthquake, to the nearest minute. This was to be accomplished
		by the use of platforms rotating beneath two mercury-filled
		bowls. As the platforms rotated, cavities
		corresponding respectively to the hour of the day
		and the minute of the hour would pass
		beneath the notches in the sides of the bowls. When mercury
		overflowed from the bowls
		through the notches, it would be conveyed into the two
		cavities corresponding to the
		hour and minute of the day. The observations reported by
		Cavalli suggest that the
		time-telling part of his seismoscope was never built
		(Cavalli, 1785). This instrument,
		if it was constructed, was the first designed to tell
		the time of an earthquake.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Duca della Torre, A. Filomarino, invented a common pendulum
		"sismografo", similar to Salsano's, but with the addition of a time-telling
		device. The first known description of this instrument is from 1796 (della Torre, 1796),
		although Salsano (1783) mentioned an instrument similar to his own, which
		he had not seen, invented contemporaneously by Duca della Torre.
		A record was to be written by a pencil
		attached to the pendulum and pressed gently with a
		spring against a piece of paper. On the pendulum mass was to be
		put a hair, which would arrest the balance wheel of a clock.
		When the mass moved, the hair would be withdrawn and the
		clock would start.
	</p>
	<p>
		Several written records were observed with this instrument.
		The records consisted of
		a pencil-line or two for each earthquake. They must have contained
		little more information about earthquake motion than could
		have been obtained from "natural seismograms", such
		as scratches left by a heavy object moving on a smooth surface.
		Nevertheless, the Duca della Torre is the first to describe
		a record obtained with an instrument constructed as a
		seismometer. The observations given by him, as reproduced by
		Baratta (1895, p. 31) do not suggest that the timing
		device was functioning.
