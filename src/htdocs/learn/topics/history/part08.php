	<h3>The Development of the Seismograph in Japan</h3>
	<p>
		Cecchi's seismograph notwithstanding, it seems clear to us
		that the credit for the introduction of the seismograph as an
		essential tool in seismology belongs to a group of British
		professors teaching in Japan in the late nineteenth century.
		These scientists obtained the first known records of ground motion
		as a function of time. Furthermore, they knew what such records
		could reveal about the nature of earthquake motion. They used
		their instruments to study the propagation of seismic waves,
		and they used them to study, for engineering purposes,
		the behavior of the ground in earthquakes.
	</p>
	<p>
		The principal figure among the British seismologists in Japan
		was John Milne. It has been noted (Davison, 1927)
		that Milne's influence on seismology extends far beyond his own
		contributions, which were themselves considerable.
		The Seismological Society of Japan was founded at Milne's urging,
		in the spring of l880, following a sharp earthquake in Yokahama.
		The society was the first devoted to seismology; its founding
		marked the beginning of a period of rapid growth of seismology in
		Japan. Nearly two decades later, Milne was to be largely responsible
		for having similar seismographs set up at stations throughout
		the world, in order to collect data which could be evaluated
		at a central observatory. Milne's own investigations were rather
		more observational than theoretical. Although Milne devised
		several significant instruments, his primary importance to
		this paper is in the use to which he put both his own and
		others' instruments.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will frequently cite the work of James Ewing and Thomas Gray,
		who designed the most important of the early instruments,
		in the years immediately following the founding of the society.
		Unfortunately, their stay in Japan was short; Gray left in 1881 and
		Ewing in 1883 (Davison, 1927). It was left largely to Milne to show
		the value to seismology of the Gray and Ewing seismographs.
		All three, Milne, Ewing and Gray, were visiting professors
		at the Imperial College of Engineering in Tokyo. The membership
		lists of the Seismological Society of Japan, in fact, reveal a
		greater number of foreign members than Japanese members
		(Seismological Society of Japan, 1880), and the instrumental
		innovations of the 1880's were due almost entirely to the
		visiting British professors.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the decade preceding 1880, several instruments were constructed
		in Japan which deserve consideration although they did not
		function successfully as seismographs. Verbeck made the first
		pendulum observations of earthquakes in Japan in 1873 (Milne, 1880a).
		Wagener (1880) constructed a common-pendulum seismometer
		which successfully detected earthquakes, but apparently
		it did not write records.

	</figure>
	<p>
		Wagener's machine is shown in Figure 7. The motion of the
		pendulum bob <i>M</i> was magnified by a mechanical lever, <i>T</i>.
		The fulcrum <i>B</i> of the lever was attached to the ground, while
		the short arm of the lever was attached to the base of the
		pendulum bob.
		The displacement of the bob relative to the ground was
		magnified twenty-four times at
		the end <i>C</i> of the long arm of the lever. To this end of the
		lever was attached a piece of thread, which was, in turn,
		wrapped around a spool <i>R</i>. As the lever moved, the thread pulled
		off the spool, thereby turning the spool. An indicating needle, <i>I</i>,
		turned with the spool to indicate the relative size of the quake.
		The pulling of the thread also stopped a clock, thus giving
		the time of the earthquake. Wagener also built an apparatus
		which determined the azimuth of the earthquake motion and the
		amplitude of vertical motion.
	</p>
	<p>
		In a seventeen-month period, in 1878, 1879 and 1880, in which
		Wagener's instrument was in operation, it detected twenty-seven
		earthquakes. The instrument seems to have been set up in the
		vicinity of Tokyo Bay (Wagener, 1880). Most of the recorded
		earthquakes were shown to have maximum ground-displacements of
		less than a millimeter, although two were indicated to have
		had a displacement greater than 2.5 millimeters. The observer
		reported that "the extent of the motion as given by the
		indicator has always been in perfect accordance with the
		violence of the shock, as far as this can be estimated by the
		feeling" (Wagener, 1880, p. 71). The vertical motion instrument
		detected vertical displacement in only eight of the twenty-seven events.
	</p>
	<p>
		Wagener planned to record the motion of the indicator
		needle continuously on a translating, rotating drum.
		He does not appear to have carried out this part of his plan
		(Ewing, 1883a, p. 38). As it was constructed, then,
		Wagener's machine still did not constitute a seismograph.
		It did not write a record, but only indicated the maximum
		horizontal shaking.
	</p>
	<p>
		W. S. Chaplin constructed a horizontal-pendulum seismometer
		in Japan in 1878 (Ewing, 1883a, p. 21). James Ewing described
		it as a "wooden rod, free to turn about a
		vertical axis, and carrying at its end a rigidly attached block".
		The instrument did not work, a failure which Ewing
		attributed to either low magnification or excessive friction
		at the pivot points. Chaplin's instrument is important as the
		first attempt to build a seismometer with a horizontal
		pendulum as a sensing element.
	</p>
	<p>
		A most interesting and important paper, entitled
		"On a neglected Principle that may be employed in Earthquake
		Measurements" was presented in 1877 to the <i>Asiatic Society
		of Japan</i> by J. Perry and W. E. Ayrton (1879). The
		authors analyzed the motion of damped and undamped
		mass-spring oscillators subjected to a periodic force.
		The relative displacement of the oscillator mass and the
		ground is expressible as a sum of steady-state terms and
		transient terms. To minimize the effect of the transient terms,
		Perry and Ayrton recommended using an oscillator with a
		period much shorter than the periods expected in an earthquake.
		That is, they recommended an accelerometer for the most
		accurate recording of earthquakes. They recognized that the
		relative displacement of the mass and the earth, with such
		an instrument, would be less than the actual displacement of the
		Earth, but they don't seem to have thought that this would
		prevent the apparatus from obtaining useable records. Perry and Ayrton
		also considered oscillators with periods greater than or equal
		to the periods of earthquake motion. They pointed out that
		these oscillators, when damped with viscous material,
		could also be used to obtain reasonably accurate records
		of earthquake motion.

		Perry and Ayrton designed an instrument to have their
		recommended short period. It was to consist of a heavy spherical weight,
		free to move horizontally and vertically, and held in equilibrium
		by five springs. The motion of the ball was to be resolved
		into three rectilinear components and written on a moving band
		of paper. This seismograph was never built. James Ewing
		(1883a, p. 69-70) criticized the design of the instrument
		on account of the probable difficulty of its construction.
		Ewing concluded, "... it is not remarkable that the principle on
		which it is based should, even after attention was directed to it,
		have remained neglected."
	</p>
	<p>
		In rejecting Perry and Ayrton's proposed short-period instrument,
		contemporary seismologists seem also to have rejected the suggestion
		that the records of longer-period seismometers would be more
		accurate representations of the Earth's motions if these
		seismometers were damped with a viscous fluid. The authors
		had recommended the use of material of high viscosity, such as
		a mixture of tar and pitch. Perhaps this suggestion hindered
		acceptance of their proposal. We shall see that artificial
		solid friction
		was tried as a means of damping a seismometer. Not until the
		turn of the century was
		viscous damping introduced into seismology, with much success,
		by Wiechert.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is time now to consider the work of John Milne, James Ewing,
		and Thomas Gray in developing the first successful seismographs
		in Japan.
		<font size=-1>
		[An interesting series of letters by Milne, Gray, and Ewing
		in <i>Nature</i> (1886-1887) discusses the question of priority for
		the invention of certain of these seismographs.
		It would appear that very few of the instruments can be
		considered the invention of one of the men exclusively.]
		</font>
	</p>
	<p>
		Ewing's first seismograph (Figure 8) used a twenty-one foot
		long common pendulum as a sensing element (Ewing, 1880a).
		Ewing anticipated that the pendulum's five-second period would
		be sufficiently long that the bob would remain stationary under
		the short pulse-like motions of the ground which he believed
		occurred in earthquakes. He took care to build a rigid frame
		for the pendulum, so that the motion of the frame would
		not contribute spurious oscillations on the record.
	</p>
	<p>
		The relative motion of the pendulum bob and the ground was
		magnified six times and recorded on a continuously-revolving,
		circular smoked-glass plate. The magnification was achieved
		with a simple lever whose fulcrum was attached to the ground.
		The short arm of the lever was attached to the pendulum bob
		and the long arm was the indicating lever, scratching a trace
		on the smoked-glass plate. Expecting that force
		due to the friction of the indicating lever would be transmitted
		back to the bob, Ewing attached the lever to the center of mass
		of the bob, so that this frictional force would not exert a
		torque on the bob and cause the bob to rotate or wobble.
		The motion of the pendulum bob could be resolved into
		two perpendicular components by the recording apparatus.

	<p>
		Ewing's common-pendulum seismograph was constructed in 1879.
		This seismograph was not operated continuously from its birth.
		It therefore did not record its first earthquake until over
		a year later. At that time, a more sophisticated instrument,
		Ewing's horizontal-pendulum seismograph, was also in operation.
		The long common pendulum
		thus did not have a major influence in the development of
		seismology by the British
		in Japan. As we shall see, however, very long common pendulums
		were later built by Italian seismologists, and these played
		a significant role in the history of seismology.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ewing's was the first successful attempt to use a horizontal
		pendulum to detect earthquakes (Ewing, 1880b, 1881c). Ewing's
		suspension is illustrated in Figure 9. A light rigid frame <i>F</i>
		is pivoted at points <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> so as to swing like a garden gate
		around the axis of rotation <i>AB</i>. At the axis of percussion of
		the frame is pivoted the cylindrical mass <i>M</i>.
		<font size=-1>
		[The mass was pivoted on a light frame in order to obtain
		the maximum inertia for a given total mass and a given distance
		of the axis of percussion from the axis of rotation
		(Ewing, 1883a, p. 17). Milne (1898a, p. 138) also pivoted
		the masses of some of his horizontal pendulums.]

	<p>
		The motion of the horizontal pendulum was magnified by means
		of a long indicator fastened to the frame of the pendulum.
		A record was inscribed on a revolving smoked-glass plate
		(Figure 10). There was no way to separate the signal
		written in one revolution from the signal written in another
		revolution. It was expected that the indicator would trace and
		retrace over the same circle on the revolving record during periods
		of quiet and, during an earthquake, would yield a signal
		superimposed on the circle. In
		practice, because the zero-line drifted, later versions
		of the instrument used a seismoscope, such as the one invented
		by Palmieri, to start the recording surface into motion at
		the time of an earthquake. In some instruments, a short pendulum
		was released in an earthquake to put time marks on the record.
		Otherwise, the relative arrival times of different phases were
		determined from the known speed of the recording surface.

		With few exceptions, the seismographs built by the British
		in Japan were intended
		to have periods longer than the periods of the waves occurring
		in earthquakes, so that the seismographs would function
		as displacement recorders. In order to test the accuracy
		of his horizontal-pendulum seismograph as a displacement recorder,
		Ewing subjected it to a "shake-table" test
		(Ewing 1881c, 1883a, p. 86). Two identical instruments were placed
		side by side on a table, the bob of one being clamped
		to a nearby wall, so that it would not move, and the bob
		of the other being left free. The table was then shaken.
		It was found that the records written by both instruments
		were nearly identical (Figure 11), showing that the bob
		of the unclamped seismograph had remained nearly stationary
		during the shaking. The "frequency" of the shaking motion
		was not reported.
	</p>
	<p>
		Both of Ewing's instruments, the common-pendulum and
		horizontal-pendulum seismographs, recorded a small earthquake
		on November 3, 1880, giving the first lengthy
		seismograph records of earthquake motion as a function of time.
		<font size=-1>
		[Milne (1880b) obtained a short seismogram, three seconds in length,
		of the Yokohama earthquake of February 22, 1880.
		He recorded the motion of a long common pendulum on a moving plate.]
		</font>
		Assuming
		that the seismometer functioned as a displacement meter,
		and assuming harmonic motion, Ewing calculated the maximum
		displacement (0.29 mm.) and maximum acceleration
		(1.6 cm/sec-sec) of the ground (Ewing, 1881a, 1883a, p. 54-55).
	</p>
	<p>
		In his report on this and four other small earthquakes recorded
		in the same month, Ewing noted the most striking features
		of these early seismograms. They were: "(1) The very gradual beginning
		and ending of the disturbance. In none of the observations did
		the maximum motion occur until after several complete
		oscillations had taken place. (2) The irregularity of the motion.
		The successive undulations are widely different both
		in extent and in periodic time. (3) The large number of
		undulations in a single earthquake, and the continuous character
		of the shock. (4) The extreme minuteness of the motion at
		the Earth's surface" (Ewing, 1883a, p. 55). The importance
		of these observations can be imagined. For the first time,
		scientists had a representation of earthquake motion, and this
		representation revealed a much different manner of shaking
		than that which had been previously thought probable.
		Specifically, Robert Mallet's widely accepted view that an
		earthquake consisted primarily of a longitudinal pulse was
		shown to be incorrect. Ewing (1881b) realized that his
		observations were fatal to methods of determining the "velocity
		of the earthquake" from the times shown
		on stopped clocks (as had been attempted by
		von Lasaulx, cited above). For the first
		time, also, seismologists could design their instruments
		with some knowledge of the phenomena the instruments were to record.
	</p>
	<p>
		A seismograph for recording vertical motion was still to be desired.
		Thomas Gray (1882) introduced a method of increasing the period
		of a mass-spring system by attaching the spiral spring
		to the short arm of a lever and attaching the mass to the long
		arm of the lever. This increased the period by increasing the
		effective mass of the pendulum bob. It was, however, desirable
		to diminish further the tendency of the mass to return to
		its zero position. Accordingly, Gray attached to the bob
		a container which was connected by a siphon to an external
		reservoir of mercury. When the bob was
		deflected downward, mercury would flow from the reservoir into
		the container on the bob, thus increasing the weight of the bob
		and neutralizing the increased restoring
		force of the spring. When the bob was deflected upward,
		mercury flowed from the container to the external reservoir,
		lightening the bob and, again, neutralizing the tendency
		of the bob to return to its equilibrium position.
	</p>
	<p>
		James Ewing (1882a) suggested that the period of Gray's
		seismometer could also be increased by attaching the spring
		to the lever arm at a point below the line connecting the
		center of mass of the pendulum and the pivot of the lever (Figure 12).
		This gives the moment arm, to which the spring is applied,
		a first-order dependence on the boom deflection, with the moment
		arm always changing so as to decrease the restoring moment of
		the pendulum. This particular suspension was adopted in Japan,
		and was to see widespread use in other vertical-motion
		instruments before the introduction of the zero-length spring.
		Gray (1887b) and Grablovitz (1891, 1896a) introduced
		other suspensions which also had the effect of
		decreasing the restoring moment acting on the lever,
		when the lever was displaced.
	</p>
	<p>
		The changing length of the spring in the Gray-Ewing vertical
		seismometer caused considerable drift. In the 1882 instrument,
		the seismometer recorded on a revolving glass plate which,
		because of the drift, was not run continuously.
		A Palmieri-type
		seismoscope was used to put the recording surface into motion
		in an earthquake.
	</p>
	<p>
		James Ewing, in 1882, joined a common pendulum with an
		inverted pendulum, so that the two would move horizontally
		together (Ewing, 1883b, 1886). He obtained
		thus a system in nearly neutral equilibrium, with
		the unstable tendency of the inverted
		pendulum lessening the stability of the common pendulum
		to which it was attached. This was Ewing's
		"duplex-pendulum" seismometer (Figure 13).
	</p>
	<p>
		The duplex-pendulum seismometer is of particular interest
		to us because in 1887 and 1888 this type of seismometer
		was placed at ten sites in Northern California and Nevada
		(Louderback, 1942). The first seismographic observatories
		in the Western Hemisphere, at Berkeley and Mount Hamilton,
		were equipped with the duplex instruments as well as
		Ewing horizontal-pendulum seismometers and Gray-Ewing vertical
		seismometers. The duplex seismometers in use here wrote
		two-dimensional particle-motion diagrams on a stationary,
		smoked glass plate.

	</figure>
	<p>
		We must introduce here yet another form of the horizontal pendulum,
		the so-called "conical pendulum", invented by Gerard in 1851
		(Gerard, 1853; Davison, 1896), and introduced to seismology
		by Thomas Gray (1881). In this suspension, the nearly horizontal
		boom is held up by a flexible wire and pivots about
		the axis of rotation on a
		bearing joint. In order to lessen the friction at the pivot point,
		James Ewing (1883a, p. 27) forked the boom and extended it
		beyond the axis of rotation (Figure 14). From the end of the fork,
		Ewing had a flat steel spring coming back to the axis of
		rotation and serving as the joint. The spring was held in tension
		by the boom; the only friction occurred internally within the flat
		spring. This type of joint has been widely used ever since.
	</p>
	<p>
		A complete summary and discussion of the instruments invented
		in Japan prior to 1883 was given by Ewing (1883a). At that time,
		unfortunately, the period of an instrument was not considered
		too important, except that it was usually intended to be
		greater then the period of the waves the seismograph was to record.
		Ewing writes,
		"When registering on a continuously moving plate, a
		well-constructed and well-adjusted seismograph should make
		one complete oscillation in about 5 seconds, and its decrement
		of amplitude should not exceed about 1 mm. per oscillation"
		(Ewing, 1883a, p. 78). Although Ewing's damping specification
		is vague, it suggests that an undamped system was considered
		most desireable. In fact, we have seen that Perry
		and Ayrton suggested the use of viscous damping, from
		theoretical considerations. Gray (1881) and Milne (1881a)
		successfully used pendulum seismometers which were intentionally
		heavily damped with solid friction. Ewing (1883a) pointed out that
		the use of solid friction would mean that there would be
		a minimum recordable acceleration, below which earthquakes
		would not record at all.

	<p>
		The use of viscous damping does not seem to have been attempted
		by the British in Japan. In fields other than seismology,
		viscous damping had been used to suppress high frequency tremors
		of pendulums so that the longer period motions could be studied
		(Rood, 1875; Darwin, 1882). In particular, the attempts of the
		Darwins (1882) to measure, with a damped pendulum apparatus,
		the lunar disturbance of gravity,
		were well known to the British in Japan. But viscous damping
		was not introduced into seismology until much later.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the seismometers of Gray and Ewing available, seismologists
		in Japan were able to make important advances in the understanding
		of earthquake motion. John Milne, especially, made extensive use
		of the new instruments.

		Milne and his colleagues conducted experiments on the
		propagation of elastic waves from artificial sources (Milne and Gray,
		1883; Milne, 1885b). The most revealing records are those of
		dynamite explosions recorded on moving glass plates by Ewing
		horizontal-pendulum seismometers and Gray-Ewing vertical seismometers
		(Figure 15). The moving plates were started into motion shortly
		before an explosion. Time signals were put on the plates.
		The records showed the normal motion outracing the transverse,
		and a slight vertical motion outracing them both. The apparent
		velocity of the wave of vertical motion was 500 feet per second.
		The maximum frequency of a
		disturbance was found to decrease with distance. In evaluating
		these observations
		today, it must be understood that the static magnification
		of the instrument was very low (four or six); early arrivals
		may not have been recorded. Also, the stations were close
		to the source (the furthest was 400 feet away), so that inaccurate
		timing would grossly affect transit velocities. Milne clearly
		believed that the normal and transverse waves were compressional
		and distortional body waves, respectively. He thought the
		vertical displacement was due to "free surface waves"
		(Milne, 1885b, p. 81).
		<font size=-1>
		[A number of investigators had written of seismic "surface waves"
		before Rayleigh (1885) demonstrated mathematically the possibility
		of surface waves on an elastic medium. The idea of surface waves
		must have been suggested to earlier scientists by the observation
		of "waves" on the surface of the ground in an earthquake.
		J. Le Conte (1882) spoke of "surface waves", but meant
		the surface projection of body waves. Mallet (1862b, vol. 2, p. 300)
		envisioned true surface waves, set up by a compressional wave
		impinging on the surface above the focus of the earthquake, and
		propagating with velocities which were probably greater than
		the compressional wave velocity. Mallet's waves were transverse
		in a vertical plane. It seems likely that Milne thought he
		was observing the surface waves hypothesized by Mallet.]
		</font>
	</p>
	<p>
		Milne placed a number of similar seismometers at different
		locations to test the effect of topography and geology on
		earthquake motion (Ewing, 1882b, Milne, 1886a, 1887a).
		It had long been observed that damage to structures seemed
		to depend on the "ground" on which they were built
		(see, for example, Dolomieu (1784) on the Calabrian earthquakes
		of 1783). Milne found that the amplitude of seismic waves recorded
		on similar seismometers also depended on the nature of
		the ground in their immediate vicinities. In "moderately strong"
		earthquakes, the recorded amplitudes were generally
		"very much greater" on "soft ground" than on "hard ground"
		(Milne, 1887a, p. 30-31). For "very small" earthquakes, this was
		not true. "Soft ground" in Milne's experiment was marshy land
		where the water-table was a few feet from the surface.
		"Hard ground" was higher land where the water-table was at
		least ten feet from the surface. The recording sites used
		by Milne were separated by several hundred to a thousand feet
		horizontally, with a maximum difference in elevation of twenty feet.
		It is worth noting that all the records were started into
		motion simultaneously by a
		seismoscope, so that the seismographs should have recorded
		the same phases. On the other hand, none of the instruments
		recorded the earliest phases, and there is no way of knowing when
		in an earthquake they did start recording. In one of the
		early experiments of this sort, Milne tested the similarity of
		the seismographs he used by placing them side by side and
		recording with them simultaneously. He observed that
		"they practically gave similar diagrams" (Milne, 1884b).

		Milne performed a similar experiment in different types of
		building construction and on different floors of the same
		building (Milne, 1888d). He compared the motion in a brick
		two-story house and a wood two-story house, situated sixty feet
		apart on "similar ground". Seismographs were placed on
		the two floors "vertically above each other and as nearly
		as possible in similar positions" (Milne, 1888d, p. 67).
		Milne found that the wood house moved more than the brick house,
		and the upstairs of each moved more than the downstairs.

		In 1882, Milne became concerned with the possibility that
		neighboring points of
		ground might move relative to each other in an earthquake.
		The presence of large strains would pose engineering problems,
		as well as render seismograph recordings less significant.
		He constructed an instrument to measure the relative motion of
		two neighboring points of ground, i.e., a strain seismometer
		(Milne, 1885b, 1888c). The instrument is shown in Figure 16.
		Two posts <i>A</i> and <i>O</i> were
		driven into the ground three feet apart.
		A rigid beam <i>R</i> was extended from one of the posts almost to the
		other post. The motion of the end of the beam with respect
		to the other post, hopefully the same as the relative motion
		of the two posts, was magnified six times by means of a simple
		lever <i>B</i> and the record written on a smoked glass plate <i>C</i>.
		In the earliest form of this seismometer, used in 1882,
		unusually large amplitudes were obtained (Milne, 1885b),
		which suggested to Milne that the beam was moving
		independently of the post to
		which it was attached. The apparatus was apparently then
		improved so that Milne felt such motion of the beam would be unlikely.
		Relative motion of several millimeters was obtained for some local
		earthquakes recorded by the system.

		Before leaving the strain seismometer, we mention another
		such instrument, built in 1900 by E. Oddone (Oddone, 1900).
		Oddone was attempting to construct a seismological apparatus
		which did not depend on a pendulum for a sensing element,
		because of the inaccuracies introduced by pendulum eigen-oscillations.
		His instrument, shown in Figure 17, was similar to
		Milne's strain seismometer, with a long, rigid beam attached
		to one pier at <i>A</i> and extending almost to a second, neighboring pier.
		A "piston" was attached to the end of the beam so as to slide
		in the "large cylinder", <i>B</i>, of a hydrostatic press which was
		mounted on the second pier. A small displacement of the piston
		in the large cylinder, equal to the relative motion between the
		two piers, caused a 3600 times larger displacement
		of the water in the "small cylinder" of the press, <i>C</i>.
		Oddone encountered difficulty in recording the displacement
		of the water in the small cylinder, however.
		He mentioned only one earthquake recorded with his instrument.

		Milne stayed in Japan until 1895. In 1892, the
		Seismological Society of Japan ceased
		to exist due to a lack of interested members (Milne, 1893a).
		The "Transactions" of the society was continued as
		the <i>Seismological Journal of Japan</i>, which was edited by
		Milne and was published until 1895, the year Milne left Japan.
		Seismology in Japan was carried on by Japanese seismologists,
		of whom Fusakichi Omori made particularly important
		contributions in the decade after Milne left. When Milne returned
		to England, he began important work in the systematic registration
		of large distant earthquakes. We will meet him again later.
