	<h3>The Seismograph Becomes an International Instrument</h3>

	<p>
		News of the successes of the British in Japan began
		to affect European seismology in the middle 1880's.
		It did not take long for most European seismologists to appreciate
		the advantages of the British instruments and begin to improve on
		them. In 1886, E. Brassart of Rome constructed common-pendulum
		seismographs after studying the seismographs made in Japan
		(Brassart, 1886; Agamennone, 1906, p. 94). The motion of
		a meter-long pendulum was resolved into perpendicular components
		and traced on smoked paper which was mounted on a cylinder.
		This instrument and modifications introduced later by
		Brassart and Agamennone (Ehlert, 1897a, p. 434; Agamennone, 1906)
		were used rather widely in Italy.
	</p>
	<p>
		A most dramatic increase of seismological activity in Europe
		followed the confirmation in 1889 that waves from large earthquakes
		could be detected by sensitive instruments located halfway
		around the world from the earthquakes' epicenters.
		We have studied, so far, only seismographs intended to record
		local earthquakes. For many years, however, there had been
		indications that the vibrations from large earthquakes traveled
		far from the regions where the earthquakes were felt,
		causing otherwise inexplicable disturbances on delicate instruments,
		such as astronomical levels and magnetometers (Baratta, 1895, 1897;
		Darwin, 1882; Fouqu&#233;, 1888b). Some observers had attempted
		to calculate the amplitude and/or the propagation velocity
		of the disturbances affecting their instruments, under the
		assumption that these disturbances originated from certain
		earthquakes (Oriani, 1783; Nyren, 1878; Fouqu&#233;, 1888b).

	<p>
		The first known recordings of a distant earthquake, which
		were identified as such, were made in 1889, also with astronomical
		instruments (Figure 18) (von Rebeur-Paschwitz, 1889).
		The instruments were horizontal pendulums, designed
		by Ernst von Rebeur-Paschwitz to measure slight changes
		in the direction of the vertical. Two of these pendulums,
		located in Potsdam and Wilhelmshaven, recorded a
		large earthquake on April 17, 1889. The earthquake had been felt
		in Japan about an hour before it was recorded in Germany.
	</p>
	<p>
		Von Rebeur's pendulum was of the form used earlier by Ewing
		in his horizontal-pendulum seismometer (von Rebeur-Paschwitz, 1894).
		It is shown in Figure 19. The instrument consisted of a rigid
		frame, rotating about two bearings <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>,
		each consisting
		of a point pressing into a socket. To the frame was attached a
		mirror <i>M</i>, which reflected light from a lamp, through a
		cylindrical lens, to a rotating drum which was covered
		with photographic paper. The drum turned 11 millimeters in an hour.
		Von Rebeur's pendulum was only 10 centimeters long, and carried
		a mass of only 42 grams. It was usually used with a period of
		from 12 to 17 seconds and a static magnification of 100
		(Ehlert, 1897a, p. 404-407). Time was obtained with a
		second fixed light trace which wrote on the same photographic paper.
		Every hour, this second trace was eclipsed for five minutes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Von Rebeur was the first to use a photographically-recording
		instrument for continuous seismological observations.
		<font size=-1>
		[Fouqu&#233; and Levy (1888) measured propagation velocities of
		explosion-generated waves by using a modification of Mallet's
		seismoscope in which a ray of light was reflected off
		of a surface of mercury onto a moving photographic plate.
		The plate was started into motion shortly before
		the explosive was detonated. Earlier, earthquakes had sometimes
		been registered on photographically-recording magnetographs
		(Fouqu&#233;, 1888b).]
		</font>
		The advantage of photographic recording was the complete absence
		of friction in magnifying and recording the relative motion
		of the pendulum and the Earth. The only sources of friction
		in von Rebeur's apparatus were the points where the pendulum arm
		was pivoted. The effect of this friction on the
		dynamic behavior of the pendulum was independent of the
		magnification of the instrument. In contrast, with mechanical
		registration, the friction between the indicator and
		the recording surface exerts a greater force on the pendulum
		according as the mechanical magnification increases. With mechanical
		registration, there exists a limit of magnification,
		above which the inertia of the pendulum cannot overcome
		the frictional forces between the indicator and the recording surface.
	</p>
	<p>
		There were, however, disadvantages to photographic registration
		as compared with mechanical registration. Photographic records
		weren't as sharp as smoked paper records. Rapid, high
		amplitude oscillations did not record on photographic paper.
		The photographic paper was expensive. And, because of expensive
		paper, many investigators recorded at such slow speeds that
		accurate timing and detailed studies of the recorded waveforms
		were impossible. Mechanical registration thus continued to be
		widely used in seismographs. We shall find, in fact, that
		by using heavy masses and reducing friction to a minimum,
		mechanically recording seismographs were built which rivalled
		the photographically recording instruments in sensitivity.

		Von Rebeur kept careful records of "earth-tremblings" recorded
		by his pendulums for several years, through a period of an
		illness of which he died in 1895, at the age of thirty-four
		(von Rebeur-Paschwitz, 1895a; Davison, 1927). In 1892 and 1893,
		he had instruments set up in Strassburg and Nicolajew,
		1800 kilometers apart. About half of the disturbances on
		his pendulums were recorded at both sites. At each location,
		only one pendulum was used. After von Rebeur's death,
		his instrument was modified by Ehlert (1897a, p. 406, 1897b),
		who increased the recording speed of the instrument and increased
		its weight, to make the pendulum less susceptible
		to movement by air currents.
	</p>
	<p>
		Contemporaneously with the development of the horizontal
		pendulum seismometers in Germany, some Italian seismologists
		extensively developed the long common-pendulum seismometer.
		G. Agamennone and A. Cancani made particularly important
		improvements in this type of seismometer. They were aware of
		the work being done in Germany, but they considered
		the common pendulum superior to the light horizontal pendulum
		for purely seismological research. At this time, Agamennone
		believed the long common pendulum to remain nearly stationary
		for short-period oscillations, in
		contrast to the German light horizontal pendulums
		which he did not think would
		remain stationary under rapid vibrations of the ground
		(Agamennone, 1894). Most of the Italian seismographs used
		mechanical registration.
	</p>
	<p>
		The first of the long common-pendulum seismographs was
		constructed by Agamennone (1893). It was designed as an
		improvement on a 1.5 meter long, 10 kilogram, Brassart-type
		seismograph (Agamennone, 1894). The smaller instrument had
		too slow a recording speed, so that individual oscillations
		could not be resolved in the seismograms. In addition,
		the mass was so light it couldn't overcome the friction of the
		writing stylus. It would remain displaced from the zero line
		after being disturbed These problems were both corrected
		in the new seismograph. It had a length of 6 meters and carried
		a mass of 75 kilograms. The success of this instrument
		prompted Agamennone to build a still larger common pendulum.
		In 1894, a 16 meter long pendulum, with a mass of
		200 kilograms, was constructed (Agamennone, 1894).
		A similar instrument built at Catania had a length of over
		25 meters (Milne, 1899, p. 259). Almost all of the
		common-pendulum seismometers employed a device to resolve
		the ground motion into mutually-perpendicular components.
		The records were written with pen and ink on relatively
		rapidly moving surfaces (Milne, 1899).

		The early Italian pendulums gave important records of
		large teleseisms. A glance at a teleseism recorded by a 7-meter long,
		common-pendulum seismometer of Cancani (Figure 20) shows that
		the two body-wave groups and the surface-wave train were fairly
		well recorded. These instruments, in fact, were the earliest
		to make such a separation of phases for teleseisms.
		Cancani proposed that the first two wave groups, corresponding
		to our P and S waves, both represented compressional waves,
		and the third, our surface waves, represented distortional waves
		(Cancani, 1893). In 1899, Oldham (1900) presented a thorough study
		of teleseismic waves, which concluded that the first wave group
		represented compressional waves, the second represented distortional
		waves, and the third represented surface waves. He relied heavily
		on data from the low-magnification Italian common-pendulum
		seismometers, believing the German horizontal-pendulum seismometers
		to be less trustworthy for his purposes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Disappointingly, however, the sensitivity of these early,
		long, common-pendulum seismometers did not approach that of
		the German light horizontal pendulums. Friction limited the
		Italian instruments to static magnifications of ten or so.
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1895, Vicentini and Pacher constructed the Vicentini
		"microsismografo", a mechanically-recording seismograph with
		a magnification nearly equal to that of the German machines
		(Pacher, 1897). The seismograph is shown in Figure 21.
		A 100 kilogram mass <i>M</i> was suspended in a 1.5 meter-long pendulum.
		The relative motion of the bob and the ground was first magnified
		by a mechanical lever <i>L</i>. The motion of this lever was resolved
		into perpendicular components at <i>V</i> and, in the process,
		the pendulum motion was magnified again. The total magnification
		was 80. The traces of the two horizontal components were written
		side by side on smoked paper, along with
		a time trace. In 1896, a large-scale version of the "microsismografo"
		was constructed, with a pendulum length of 10.68 meters and a bob
		of weight 400 kilograms (Pacher, 1897).
	</p>
	<p>
		A vertical-component seismometer was later introduced by Vicentini
		and Pacher (1898). Rather than employing suspension with a
		spiral spring for restoring force, Vicentini and Pacher used a
		flat spring, clamped to the wall at one end and loaded with
		a weight at the other end. The instrument was clamped so that
		the loaded end of the flat spring, bent under the weight of the mass,
		was horizontal. As finally developed, the mass oscillated vertically
		with a fundamental period of 1.2 seconds. The vertical seismometer
		wrote with a static magnification of 130 on a smoked-paper
		record which was constantly in motion.

		In 1895, John Milne left Japan and returned to England,
		where he established a seismological observatory on the Isle
		of Wight (Davison, 1927). He concentrated now on the study of
		unfelt earth movements, both microseisms and teleseisms. Milne
		made extensive use of a horizontal-pendulum seismograph which
		he designed in 1894, while he was still in Tokyo (Figure 22)
		(Milne, 1894b). The instrument recorded photographically.
		Instead of having light reflected onto photographic paper
		with a mirror fastened
		to the frame of the pendulum, Milne had light shine onto
		the paper through the intersection of two mutually-perpendicular
		slits. One of the slits was fastened to the pier.
		The other slit was fastened to the pendulum, and moved with
		the pendulum, thus causing the spot of light to move on the paper.
		Leveling screws in the base of the apparatus made possible a
		determination of the static tilt sensitivity of the pendulum
		by giving the base of the instrument a small known tilt and
		observing the resulting displacement of the trace. Static
		magnification may be calculated from an instrument with known period
		and known static tilt sensitivity. Milne's instruments usually
		had a period of about fifteen seconds and a static magnification of six.

		Milne pressed for the establishment of a world-wide network
		of seismographic stations, with standard instruments (Milne, 1897).
		Milne's photographically-recording horizontal-pendulum seismograph
		was selected by a committee of the British Association for the
		Advancement of Science to be the standard instrument for such
		an undertaking. By 1900, similar Milne seismographs were established
		on all of the inhabited continents
		(Milne, 1901).
		<font size=-1>
		[The desirability of having a station in the Antarctic region was
		also apparent at this time. In 1902, a Milne instrument was
		operated near the shore of the Ross Sea, at 77 degrees 50 minutes
		south latitude as part of the British national antarctic expedition
		of 1901-1904. The seismograph recorded over one hundred teleseisms
		in the period of months in which it was operated (Milne, 1905).]
		</font>
		Sixteen stations
		were regularly sending records to Milne (Figure 23). Using data
		from the Milne seismographs, and published data from German and
		Italian observatories, Milne plotted travel-time curves for
		teleseisms with known epicenters. The first curve (Milne, 1898a)
		gave only the transit time of the phase of maximum amplitude,
		which, on seismograms made with the Milne seismograph,
		usually corresponded to our surface waves. A year later,
		the transit times of
		both the "preliminary tremors" and the phase of maximum amplitude
		were plotted (Milne, 1899). The transit times of the
		"second preliminary tremors" were plotted by Oldham (1900),
		who correctly inferred that the wave group was composed of
		transverse waves. Milne began systematic location of large
		teleseisms, using arrival times of the maximum phases, felt reports,
		and the time intervals between the arrival of preliminary tremors
		and the maximum phase (Milne, 1900b).

		Italian seismologists began using horizontal-pendulum seismometers
		toward the end of the nineteenth century. In 1895, G. Grablovitz
		built a seismometer of the type earlier devised by Gray (above)
		- a horizontal pendulum pivoting on a single point and held up
		by a flexible wire (Grablovitz, 1896a). At first, Grablovitz
		used three horizontal pendulums, no two of them colinear,
		recording simultaneously at a single location. This was so that
		the direction of propagation could be determined from the
		amplitude of the recorded waves alone without knowledge of the
		phase of the wave for each component. This method of determining
		the direction of propagation assumes that the ground particles
		are known to vibrate either longitudinally or transversely:
		it still results in an ambiguity of 180 degrees for the direction
		of propagation. The method was required by the slow recording
		speed used by Grablovitz, which made it impossible to match up
		an individual oscillation from one component with an individual
		oscillation on another component. The simultaneous use of three
		horizontal components had been suggested by other authors
		(Ehlert, 1897a, p. 358, 403, 406). In a later version of
		his instrument, Grablovitz (1896b) increased the recording
		speed and used only two pendulums at right angles to each other.
		The improved version of Grablovitz's horizontal pendulum carried
		a mass of twelve kilograms. It had a static
		magnification of eight, and was used with a period of
		around seventeen seconds. A. Cancani built a larger
		horizontal-pendulum apparatus (Cancani, 1897). Cancani's
		seismometer used a suspension similar to that used by Ewing,
		with two bearing points. This seismometer wrote with pen and
		ink on a surface moving at the relatively rapid rate of
		sixty centimeters per hour. The period of the instrument was
		usually about twenty-four seconds. The Stiattesi horizontal pendulum,
		introduced in 1900, was a larger seismometer built on the same
		principle as the Cancani horizontal-pendulum seismometer
		(Agamennone, 1906, p. 115).

			instrument was diminished by its lack of damping.

		F. Omori, a pupil and colleague of Milne's, constructed
		horizontal-pendulum seismographs. As with the instrument of
		Grablovitz, each pendulum consisted of a mass on a rod, pivoting
		about a socket, with the mass held up by a flexible wire
		(Omori, 1899). The static magnifications of Omori's instruments
		were about ten, and they were given periods of about twenty seconds.
		These instruments were prototypes of the Bosch-Omori seismograph
		which was widely used throughout the world in the early
		twentieth century. The Bosch-Omori seismograph was built by
		the firm of J.A. Bosch,
		of Strassburg. In 1907, Bosch added damping to Omori's
		originally undamped seismometer (Sieberg, 1923, p. 442).
