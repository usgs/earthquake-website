	<h3>Further Studies with Seismoscopes</h3>

	<p>
		The years between 1850 and 1870 saw several significant contributions
		to seismological instrumentation. These included Palmieri's seismoscope
		for recording the time of an earthquake, and a suggestion by Z&#246;llner
		that the horizontal pendulum might be used in a seismometer.
		Mallet studied earthquake motion by observing the effects of
		earthquakes and by measuring the velocity of elastic waves generated
		by explosions. A true seismograph still eluded seismologists.

		Explosion seismology was born in 1851, when Robert Mallet used
		dynamite explosions to measure the speed of elastic waves in surface
		rocks (Mallet, 1852, 1862a).
		He wished to obtain approximate values
		for the velocities with which earthquake
		waves were likely to travel. To detect the waves from
		the explosions, Mallet looked through
		an eleven-power magnifier at the image of a cross-hairs
		reflected in the surface of mercury
		in a container (see Figure 3). A slight shaking
		caused the image to blur
		or disappear. Transit velocities were measured over distances of the
		order of a thousand feet. For granite, Mallet obtained velocities of
		about 1600 feet per second. He had expected
		to find velocities of 8000 feet per second. The unexpectedly low
		elastic-wave velocity was attributed to the heterogeneity of
		the rock through which the wave traveled. Later investigators
		(Abbot, 1878; Fouqu&#233; and Levy, 1888), using
		instruments similar to Mallet's,
		have found higher velocities and have suggested that Mallet
		may not have detected the earliest arrivals in his experiments.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mallet advocated the use of fallen objects and cracks in
		buildings as aids in the study
		of earthquakes. He made a detailed investigation of the
		Neapolitan earthquake of 1857,
		in which he paid particular attention to the way
		buildings were cracked, walls
		overthrown, and soft ground fissured (Mallet, 1862b). Mallet
		believed that an earthquake
		consisted primarily of a compression followed
		by a dilatation. For such a shaking,
		he suggested, the resulting cracks in structures would be
		transverse to the direction of
		wave propagation. Overturned objects would fall along
		the horizontal projection of the direction of wave propagation.
		By observing the directions of arrival
		from a number of different points, he plotted
		an origin from which the wave seemed to spread. Mallet
		also published a set of formulae for calculating
		the velocities necessary
		to overturn
		structures of various simple shapes. From these,
		and observations of overturned objects,
		he estimated the velocity of particle motion at
		different sites.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mallet's assumption that earthquakes consisted mainly of
		longitudinal motion was
		proven invalid as soon as seismometers were built
		which recorded the large transverse
		component of ground motion. Interest remained in the
		possibility of using overturned
		columns and other ruins as seismoscopes for
		measuring certain parameters of
		earthquakes, such as particle velocity and acceleration.
		In the 1880's, investigators in Japan
		checked Mallet's method of calculating
		ground velocity from observations of bodies
		overturned or displaced by earthquake motion.
		Velocities calculated from Mallet's
		formulae did not in general agree with those
		calculated from seismograms
		(Milne, 1885b). J. Milne and F. Omori introduced a
		formula for the acceleration necessary to
		overturn columns, which they checked by putting columns
		on a cart and shaking them with a
		sinusoidal motion (Milne and Omori, 1893).
		Omori applied the formula to
		gravestones overturned in the epicentral region
		of the Mino-Owari earthquake of October 28,
		1891 (Milne, 1893c). He found accelerations
		greater than 0.4 g.

		A design of a pendulum seismoscope was reported
		by Kreil (1855). In this instrument, the pendulum mass
		was to be a cylinder, on which recording paper
		was to be wrapped. The recording stylus, fixed to the ground,
		would write on the pendulum mass
		as it moved in an earthquake. The mass was to be rotated
		by a clock at a rate of once every
		twenty-four hours. In this way, the time of an
		earthquake could be noted.
		There is no evidence that Kreil's machine
		was built, although its design seems to have been
		considered significant by seismologists of the day
		(Mallet, 1859, p. 76).
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1858, P. G. M. Cavalleri (1858, 1860) reported
		the construction of a common-pendulum
		seismometer similar to that described by Bina,
		more than one hundred years earlier. As in Bina's
		instrument, a pointer on the pendulum bob traced
		a record of the motion of the pendulum
		in fine powder. Observations of felt
		earthquakes suggest to Calvalleri that
		the frequency of earthquake waves would be three cycles
		per second. For this frequency, the 1.25 meter-long common
		pendulum would function
		approximately as a displacement meter,
		as its inventor intended.
	</p>
	<p>
		Cavalleri described other instruments. A mass on a
		spiral spring was intended to
		detect vertical motion. It had a period of
		one second - long enough, Cavalleri felt, to
		record the rapid pulse-like vertical displacement
		of the ground believed to occur
		in an earthquake. The mass of this instrument was
		connected to the short arm of an indicating lever.
		The lever was constructed so that it would
		remain at the position of
		its maximum excursion.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, in order to study the frequency
		content of earthquake waves, Cavalleri
		constructed six short pendulums of different
		periods, each of which traced the record
		of its motion in fine powder, as the larger pendulum did.
		Assuming that a range of frequencies
		from two to four cycles per second would
		be "sufficient to embrace every
		undulation occasioned by any earthquake"
		(Cavalleri, 1860, p. 113), Cavalleri expected
		that the pendulum whose period was closed to the
		predominant period of the
		earthquake would resonate and show a larger amplitude
		than the other pendulums. This apparatus
		was new to Europeans. Jared Brooks of
		Louisville, Kentucky, had constructed pendulums
		of different lengths to observe the
		New Madrid earthquakes of 1811 and 1812
		(Fuller, 1912, p. 32).
	</p>
	<p>
		In 1856, Luigi Palmieri installed his "sismografo elettro-magnetico"
		in the volcanic observatory on Mount Vesuvius
		(Palmieri, 1871, 1874). This instrument was intended
		to give the direction, intensity, and duration of an earthquake,
		and was capable of responding to both horizontal and vertical motions.
		It was not a "seismograph" in the sense in which we are using the word,
		but rather a collection of seismoscopes, each intended to record
		particular parameters of an earthquake (Figure 4).

	<p>
		The seismoscope for detecting vertical motion consisted of a
		conical mass on a spiral spring. The mass was suspended just
		over a basin of mercury. When a slight motion caused the tip
		of the cone to touch the mercury, an electric circuit was completed,
		which caused a clock to stop, indicating the time of the shock.
		The spiral spring was constructed so that
		thermal changes in the length of the spring were balanced by
		thermal changes in the length of the frame to which
		the spring was attached.
	</p>
	<p>
		Horizontal motion was detected with common pendulums,
		whose swinging completed the same circuit as that completed
		by the mass-spring seismoscope.
		In addition, U-tubes filled with mercury were used to detect
		horizontal motion.
	</p>
	<p>
		The closing of the above-mentioned electric circuit,
		besides stopping the clock, started a paper recording
		surface and caused a pencil to be pressed against the surface.
		The recorder, once started, continued running until the
		paper was used up. Every time
		the circuit was completed, a pencil dash would be left
		on the moving paper. The duration of the quake was thereby recorded.
		The size of the earthquake was indicated by the amplitude of
		oscillations suffered by a mass on a spring and by the
		amplitudes of the oscillations of the mercury in the U-tubes.
		The size of the earthquake was measured in "degrees".
	</p>

		Palmieri's "sismografo" seems to have been an effective
		earthquake detector for its
		time. Palmieri used it for many years on Mount Vesuvius and
		detected numerous shocks with the instrument (Palmieri, 1862a,
		1862b, 1864, 1866, 1867, 1869, 1870, 1876).
		Disturbingly, however, the instrument was unable to detect
		many shocks which were felt in the nearby city of Naples.
		Palmieri, in fact, believed that the apparatus functioned
		better as a predictor of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
		He observed that many instances before the eruption of Vesuvius
		or other Mediterranean volcanoes, or before large earthquakes
		in the Mediterranean area, his seismoscope would detect
		"shocks". But when the earthquakes occurred, even if
		they were felt in Naples, the instrument would not detect them.
		(Fortunately, an identical instrument located in Naples did
		detect the earthquakes felt there.) Palmieri observed that
		before Vesuvius was going to erupt, the "shocks are more frequent;
		or to express it better, the ground trembles in a continuous
		manner with diverse phases"  (Palmieri, 1867).
	</p>
	<p>
		Palmieri's "sismografo" was later used by seismologists in Japan.
		For ten years it was used to detect earthquakes in Tokyo;
		565 earthquakes were detected from October, 1875 to March, 1885
		(Milne, 1880c, 1883b, 1885c). For most of these earthquakes,
		"force" (the size of the earthquake in "degrees") and direction
		of motion, as well as time, are catalogued, indicating that the
		whole "sismografo" was functioning. It should be noted that some
		workers in Japan did not believe the "force" to be necessarily
		even an approximate indication of the relative "intensity"
		of different earthquakes (see, for example, Ewing, 1883a, p. 72).
	</p>
	<p>
		After 1885, routine earthquake recording in Tokyo was taken
		over by the new seismographs just developed in Japan,
		but Palmieri's circuit-closing seismoscopes were used past the
		turn of the century as triggering devices to start recording
		systems in other seismographs (Holden, 1898). One such seismoscope
		was among the seismographic equipment at Mount Hamilton, California,
		at the time of the California earthquake of April 18, 1906.
		The seismoscope did not trigger the other seismographs until
		thirty-three seconds after the first tremors were felt at
		Mount Hamilton (Read, 1910, p. 64).

		The horizontal pendulum appears to have been independently
		invented several
		times in the nineteenth century (Darwin, 1882; Davison, 1896).
		In 1869, Z&#246;llner described a horizontal pendulum with the
		suspension which has since been associated with his name
		(Z&#246;llner, 1869, 1872). Z&#246;llner's suspension is shown in Figure 5.
		The rod <i>R</i>, with a mass on one end, rotates about the axis <i>AC</i>,
		which is inclined at an angle <i>i</i> to the vertical, <i>V</i>. The rod is
		supported by wires <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i>, which are attached to the rod at
		points <i>B</i> and <i>D</i> some distance from each other. A mirror on
		the pendulum was used to reflect a light beam from a lamp to a scale,
		where the motion of the pendulum, as magnified by the optical lever,
		was directly observed. The instrument was installed in the cellar
		of the university in Leipzig; Z&#246;ller could detect significant
		movement of the pendulum due to the filling up of the
		auditorium on the second floor of the building. The pendulum was
		built in order to observe changes in the direction of gravity
		due to tidal forces, but Z&#246;llner suggested that it might also be
		valuable as
		a seismometer.

	<p>
		Horizontal pendulums were to be widely used in seismographs after
		1880, because
		they could be given long periods and could still be compact.
		There were several different suspensions used in these
		later horizontal-pendulum instruments. The Z&#246;llner suspension
		was used in the Galitzin horizontal seismograph. The suspension
		of the Wood-Anderson torsion seismometer may be considered
		a limiting case of the Z&#246;llner suspension.
