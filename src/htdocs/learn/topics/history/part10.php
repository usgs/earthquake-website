	<h3>Early Studies of "Microseisms"</h3>

	<p>
		Virtually all of the early pendulum seismographs sometimes
		gave records of vibratory disturbances which lasted for hours
		and even days, and which seemed quite unrelated to earthquakes.
		We have alluded to the study of such small motions of pendulums
		in our paragraphs on Italian seismometry of the 1870's.
		It would be well to consider briefly the history of these
		investigations.
	</p>
	<p>
		T. Bertelli (1873) has found studies of "spontaneous" pendulum
		motions as far back as 1643. He reports that the first
		investigators concluded that the motions were due to local or
		accidental causes, or were optical illusions. Bertelli began
		the first systematic observation of these motions in 1870
		(De Rossi, 1877, p. 11). He noted a dependence of pendulum
		activity upon regional weather conditions, with greater
		activity occurring in winter and accompanying low-pressure zones.
		Bertelli believed that the pendulum motions were caused by tremors,
		from natural forces acting on a regional scale. This view was
		contested by a contemporary, P. Monte, who felt that the pendulum
		movements were due to local causes, such as air currents and
		cultural noise. De Rossi (1874b, 1875) has summarized the controversy
		between Bertelli and Monte. De Rossi undertook to explain the
		difference between the views of Bertelli
		and Monte, and he concluded that some of the motions were
		tectonic in origin (De Rossi, 1874a). He sensed a correlation
		between "tremor storms" and earthquakes. Largely at his urging,
		observatories were established in Italy to note the state of
		"endogenous activity", and the name "endogeneous meteorology" was
		applied to the study of the interior of the earth (De Rossi, 1883).
		The tremors at each station were observed with a "tromometer",
		consisting of a common pendulum whose motions were observed directly
		through a microscope. Daily maps were published showing tromometric
		activity throughout Italy. The project was abandoned, however,
		because of the difficulty of separating tremors due to tectonic
		forces from tremors due to air
		currents and traffic (Agamennone, 1906, p. 41).
	</p>

		Meanwhile, the "spontaneous pendulum movements" had attracted the
		interest of other scientists. The attempt of an English group to
		measure the lunar perturbation of
		gravity was thwarted because of the high level of background
		vibrations. Darwin (1882, 1883), who wrote the report of the group,
		has given a more complete history than we have been able to give
		of the early studies of spontaneous vibrations. Von Rebeur-Paschwitz
		(1894, 1895a) also carried out extensive studies of the motions
		exhibited by his horizontal pendulums.
	</p>

		John Milne began studies of "tremors" in 1879, in the hopes that
		earthquakes in
		Japan would be preceded by detectable noises, as the faults
		responsible for the earthquakes were preparing to break
		(Milne, 1882b).
		<font size=-1>
		[The view that earthquakes originate from faults was referred to
		by Milne (1886b, p. 221) as the "ordinary supposition".
		De Rossi (1874a) had earlier hypothesized that waves were
		generated at the time of an earthquake by the lips of a "volcanic
		fracture" moving rapidly up and down with respect to each other.
		The Mino-Owari earthquake of October 28, 1891, with its spectacular
		faulting, helped convince Milne that faulting caused earthquakes
		by the release of strain energy which had been stored in rock
		through the slow deformation of the Earth's crust (Milne, 1898b,
		p 24-38). Another widely-held theory, suggested by Mallet (1862b)
		was that earthquakes were caused by water, rapidly vaporizing
		and condensing within the Earth. Milne used a microphone in his
		1879 studies. His approach is similar to some used in today's
		renewed attack on earthquake prediction.]
		</font>
		His views on the causes of "tremors" changed over two decades of
		study. In 1887, he suggested that the tremors were
		caused by wind and were propagated to areas where no wind was
		blowing (Milne, 1887b). In 1893, he altered his position, and
		held that tremors, or "earth pulsations", were caused by atmospheric
		pressure changes (Milne, 1893c). Milne did not specify whether
		the disturbances, once generated, propagated as elastic waves.
		He likened the pulsations to "the swells upon an ocean"
		(Milne, 1893c, p. 103-104). By 1898, however, Milne (1898b) had
		concluded that most spontaneous pendulum motions were caused by
		purely local phenomena, or were perhaps instrumental disturbances.
		The "tremors" studied by Milne had periods of several minutes.
		Milne gave convincing evidence that many were caused by small
		air currents around the instrument. Some were also thought to be
		due to the effect of climate on the soil outside the building
		in which the instrument was housed. For some disturbances,
		he had no sure explanation.

		Milne (1898b) was drawn to investigate the so-called
		"diurnal wave", a daily drift of the position of pendulum bobs
		which had also been studied intensively by von Rebeur-Paschwitz
		(1894, 1895a). Milne believed, with von Rebeur, that the drift
		was associated with the passage of the sun across the sky. He did
		not determine a definite cause for the diurnal wave, although
		he suggested that it might result from unequal evaporation of
		moisture from the ground surrounding the instrument.
	</p>

		One wonders how many of the pre-1900 investigators were actually
		observing the background elastic-wave noise which we today call
		"microseisms". Most of the early seismographs were very
		insensitive by today's standards, and to be recorded, micro-seismic
		motion would have had to be very large. Some of the most convincing
		seconds of "microseisms" were obtained by Omori (1899). The periods
		of these disturbances were between four and eight seconds, whereas
		the periods of the recording instruments were twice as long.
		The records reproduced by Omori (Figure 24) resemble the records
		of "storm microseisms" which we obtain at Berkeley today.
		But the amplitudes of the displacements in the waves were as great
		as 0.2 millimeters, an order of
		magnitude
		higher than the maximum microseismic amplitudes one would expect
		for such periods at a noisy site (Brune and Oliver, 1959).
