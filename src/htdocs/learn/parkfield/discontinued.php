<p> For a variety of reasons, several monitoring networks have
  been discontinued. Reasons include changes in personnel, poorly
  designed networks or instruments, or natural hazards (floods)
  that caused the instrument to fail.</p>
<h2>Tilt</h2>
  <p>A network of four, closely spaced shallow borehole tiltmeters
  were located near Parkfield at Gold Hill. The instruments were located down-hole below the surface. Data were recorded
  on-site and transmitted every 10 minutes with digital telemetry
  via satellite to Menlo Park. Although the observed tilts due
  to solid-earth tides are consistent with other measurements,
  the longer term tilts recorded by these instruments are believed
  to be contaminated by instabilities in the near surface materials.
  The tilt resolution is approximately 0.1 to 1 microradian
  at periods of days, and 0.01 to 0.1 microradian at periods
  of hours. </p>
  <h2>Ultra-low
  Frequency Magnetic Fields (ULF) </h2>
<p>An attempt to measure ultra low frequency (ULF) magnetic
  signals prior to further earthquakes was made in Parkfield,
  California. Independent ULF measurement systems have been
  installed at the Varian and Haliburton ranches near Parkfield
  and at Pi&ntilde;on Flat and Table Mountain in Southern California. </p>
<h2>Leveling</h2>
<p>A network of leveling lines in the Parkfield region was repeatedly
  surveyed beginning in 1977, in a cooperative effort with the
  University of California, Santa Barbara. The networks consisted
  of 7 lines, and included: a 10-km-long line perpendicular
  to the San Andreas fault at Parkfield; a 32-km-long line near
  Middle Mountain; a 17-km-long line perpendicular to the fault
  at the southern end of the 1966 rupture zone; and a 24-km-long
  line parallel to the fault line. Short (less than 1 km) sections
  of these long lines were surveyed 3 to 4 times per year. </p>
<h2>Small Aperture
  Networks</h2>
<p>Three small aperture trilateration networks spanned the Parkfield
  section of the San Andrea fault. Standard errors for individual
  measurement are 4 mm. Thirty-one near fault lines were surveyed
  quarterly.</p>
<h2>Liquefaction array </h2>
<p>Liquefaction is said to occur when, as consequence of high
  pore pressure within a water saturated sand, the sand mass
  undergoes a significant decrease in shear strength and large
  deformation may occur under the existing level of vibrational
  stress. To understand the process of liquefaction the USGS
  and EPRI selected a site, about 15 km southeast of Parkfield
  and 0.7 km from the San Andreas fault, to install liquefaction
  sensing instrumentation, that included accelerometers and
  piezometers. A piezometer instrument is used to measure hydrostatic
  pressure, such as within saturated sand. There were also 8
  bench marks installed with calibrated elevations to measure
  any surface subsidence which may occur during liquefaction
  The goal of the experiment was to monitor pore pressure in
  the sand deposit as it undergoes liquefaction and simultaneously
  record the acceleration levels within the sand layer. This
  data lead to a better understanding of ground failure due
  to liquefaction and enabled engineers and scientists to improve
  their capability to predict the magnitude and extent of failure
  due to liquefaction. This study focused on measuring ground
  vibrations and are designed to improve the capability of predicting
  the response of engineered structures to ground shaking. For
  this purpose, instrumented experiments were being conducted
  on lifeline facilities, unreinforced masonry structures, and
  school buildings. The data collected is being used to design
  structures that are more resistant to shaking damage.</p>
<h2>Vibroseis
  Survey </h2>
<p>One-hundred-sixteen seismometers and accelerators were deployed
  by the University of California, Berkeley and Santa Barbara,
  in a 5,150-foot deep well (the Varian 1-A well near the San
  Andreas fault). A surface vibrator (<a href="https://ncedc.org/hrsn/">VIBROSEIS</a>)
  was used as a source of seismic energy to measure subtle changes
  in seismic velocities in the crustal rocks along the fault
  near Parkfield. The Parkfield network is described by <a href="/learn/parkfield/scientific.php#Kara92">Karageorgi
    et al</a>.</p>
<h2>Fluid
  pressure transducers</h2>
<p>Pore-pressure fluctuations and variation in temperature in
  the over-pressured zone at the bottom of the Varian 1-A well
  are monitored. The proximity of the well not only to the fault,
  but also to the expected epicenter of the previously predicted
  magnitude 6 shock, suggests that these observations might
  be critical in understanding the details of the process leading
  to the next Parkfield earthquake. </p>
<h2>Groundwater
  Radon and Soil Hydrogen</h2>
<p>Although geotechnical data recorded at properly located stations
  has been found to show anomalous changes before earthquakes,
  the mechanism for these changes is not understood. Radon,
  hydrogen and carbon dioxide gas, and temperature in ground
  water were maintained in wells near Parkfield. Water samples
  were collected periodically from these and several other wells
  for chemical analysis. In addition continuous soil-gas radon
  and hydrogen monitors were installed near some of the groundwater
  monitoring sites.</p>
