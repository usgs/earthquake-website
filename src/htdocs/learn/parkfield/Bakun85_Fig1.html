<figcaption>Fig. 1. Map of earthquake epicenters (1975-1984) relative to the trace
      of the San Andreas fault (bold line) and the epicenters of the foreshock
      (M<sub>L</sub> 5.1) and the main shock in 1966 (small and large stars,
      respectively, near the center of the map). All epicenters were calculated
      from a crustal velocity model designed specifically for the Parkfield
      section of the San Andreas fault (55). Brackets along the fault show the
      preparation zone and rupture zone of characteristic Parkfield earthquakes.
      Epicenter clusters near the western edge (faint line) of the San Joaquin
      Valley are aftershocks of the earthquakes at Cantua Creek in 1975, at
      Avenal in 1976, at New Idria in 1982, and at Coalinga in 1983. Epicenters
      for all earthquakes of M<sub>L</sub> 2.3 or greater are shown,
      except the very many aftershocks (M<sub>L</sub> &lt; 3) of the
      1983 Coalinga earthquake, which cover the Coalinga area when plotted.</figcaption></figure>
