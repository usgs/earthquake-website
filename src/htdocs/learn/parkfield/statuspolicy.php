<p>In 1985, the USGS developed a plan, detailed in <a
href="/learn/parkfield/scientific.php#B">OF 87-192</a>, on which it would
        base earthquake warnings for Parkfield and has assisted state,
        county, and local officials in the Parkfield area to prepare
        a coordinated, reasonable response to a warning, should one
        be issued. Recent changes have been made to this alert system.
        The plan defines four &quot;status levels&quot; (A, B, C and
        D), that may be issued when specified observations of earthquake
        activity or fault creep are made. The status levels and criteria
        for meeting them are summarized in an <a href="/learn/parkfield/statusscheme.php">status
        scheme table</a>.</p>
<p>Under the plan, the USGS would notify the California
Office of Emergency Services (OES) when a Status A is declared. California OES has the responsibility to disseminate hazard warnings to the public, to county and local officials, and to the press. A public warning will be issued by OES whenever the USGS declares an A-status. Status A alerts not followed
within 72 hours by the anticipated Parkfield earthquake are considered false alarms. Status B, C and D signify periods of increased earthquake likelihood, but are not of sufficient concern to warrant public warnings. The history of status levels declared at Parkfield are summarized in <a href="/learn/parkfield/status_history.pdf">17 status history tables</a>.</p>

<p>The earthquake prediction at Parkfield was announced to the public by the Director of the USGS in April, 1985. The <a href="/learn/parkfield/pressrelease.html">announcement</a> stated that there was a 90% probability of an earthquake with Magnitude 5.5 to 6.0 occurring sometime between 1985 and 1993. The prediction drew great media attention.</p>
<p>The California OES mailed a detailed brochure about the earthquake prediction to more than 122,000 households in the Parkfield area. Entitled &quot;<a href="/learn/parkfield/caoes.html">The Parkfield Earthquake Prediction</a>,&quot; the brochure included information about the earthquake hazard, the prediction, a possible short-term warning, and how to prepare for and respond to the earthquake. The affected counties participated in the public information program. </p>
<p> An assessment of the public's understanding of and response to the information provided about the prediction was reported in <em>Fostering Public Preparations for Natural Hazards</em> (Mileti et al., 1992). Mileti and his coworkers surveyed three communities within the Parkfield area. They found that almost everyone in the surveyed communities had heard about the prediction; that the information enhanced the public's perception of earthquake risk; and that the information prompted many people to prepare for the anticipated earthquake.</p>
