<figcaption>Figure 2. Vertical along-strike cross-sections showing the earthquakes examined in this study. Circles provide and estimate of event size, using the relation between moment (Mo) and magnitide (M); logMo) = 1.0M + 9.8. a. Locations from the NCSN catalogue of 2,410 earthquakes selected as belonging to miltiplets (black) and 830 earthquakes not selected (orange). Inset, the magnitude distribution of the entire catalogue (thin line) and those earthqaukes not grouped into multiples (thick line). b. The 65 multiplets following relocation. The absolute location of the centre of each multiplet is taken to be the average of the NCSN catalogue locations of its member events. The relocation shifted the earthquakes by median distances of 180m horizontally and 300m vertically, consistent with the relative magnitudes of horizontal and vertical location errors in the NCSN catalogue.
