      and Michael (1993)</a>. Velocity solution in (a) map-view at 4-km depth,
      and (b) southeast-northwest (B-B') and (c) southwest-northeast (A-A') cross
      sections. Velocity color scale is shown in lower right. magnetic body modeled
      by R.C. Jachens (USGS) is indicated by thickness contour lines (km) in (a).
      MM, Middle Mountain; GH, Gold Hill; CL, Coalinga epicenter; KH, kettleman
      Hills epicenter. In cross sections, SAF, San Andreas fault; CA, Coalinga
      Anticline. Asterisks in (c) show hypocenters of the 1966 Parkfield and 1984
      Coalinga earthquakes. (d) Resistivity model computed by S.D. Stanley (USGS),
      usiing magnetotelluric data in a 2-D inversion. Triangles indicate observations
      points.</td>
