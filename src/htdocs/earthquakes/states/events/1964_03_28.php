This great earthquake and ensuing tsunami took 131 lives (tsunami 122,
earthquake 9), and caused about $2.3 billion in property loss (in 2013 dollars; equivalent to $311 million in 1964).
Earthquake effects were heavy in many towns,
including Anchorage, Chitina, Glennallen, Homer,
Hope, Kasilof, Kenai, Kodiak, Moose Pass, Portage,
Seldovia, Seward, Sterling, Valdez, Wasilla, and
Whittier.
</p>
<p>
Anchorage, about 120 kilometers northwest of the
epicenter, sustained the most severe damage to property.
About 30 blocks of dwellings and commercial buildings
were damaged or destroyed in the downtown
area. The J.C. Penney Company building was damaged
beyond repair; the Four Seasons apartment
building, a new six-story structure, collapsed; and
many other multistory buildings were damaged
heavily. The schools in Anchorage were almost devastated.
The Government Hill Grade School, sitting astride a huge
landslide, was almost a total loss.
Anchorage High School and Denali Grade School
were damaged severely. Duration of the shock was
estimated at 3 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Landslides in Anchorage caused heavy damage.
Huge slides occurred in the downtown business
section, at Government Hill, and at Turnagain Heights.
The largest and most devastating landslide occurred
at Turnagain Heights. An area of about 130 acres
was devastated by displacements that broke the ground
into many deranged blocks that were
collapsed and tilted at all angles. This slide destroyed
about 75 private houses. Water mains and gas,
sewer, telephone, and electrical systems were
disrupted throughout the area.

The earthquake was accompanied by vertical
displacement over an area of about 520,000
square kilometers. The major area of uplift trended
northeast from southern
Kodiak Island to Price William Sound and trended
east-west to the east of the sound. Vertical displacements
ranged from about 11.5 meters of uplift to 2.3 meters
of subsidence relative to sea level. Off the southwest
end of Montague Island, there was absolute vertical
displacement of about 13 - 15 meters. Uplift also occurred
along the extreme southeast coast of Kodiak Island,
Sitkalidak Island, and over part or all of Sitkinak
Island. This zone of subsidence covered about
285,000 square kilometers, including the north and west parts of
Prince William Sound, the west part of the Chugach
Mountains, most of Kenai Peninsula, and almost all
the Kodiak Island group.

<p>
This shock generated a tsunami that devastated
many towns along the Gulf of Alaska, and left serious damage
at Alberni and Port Alberni, Canada, along
the West Coast of the United States (15 killed), and
in Hawaii. The maximum wave height recorded was
67 meters at Valdez Inlet. Seiche action in rivers, lakes,
bayous, and protected harbors and waterways along
the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas caused minor
damage. It was also recorded on tide gages in Cuba
and Puerto Rico.
</p>
<p>
This great earthquake was felt over a large area of
Alaska and in parts of western Yukon Territory and
British Columbia, Canada.

by the 1960 Concepci&oacute;n, Chile, earthquake (purple curves) and
by the 1964 Good Friday, Valdez (Anchorage), Alaska earthquake (red curves).
The 1960 tsunamis killed 61 people and caused about $24 million in damage.
