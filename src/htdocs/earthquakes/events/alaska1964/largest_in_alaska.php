  This earthquake and ensuing tsunami took 131 lives (tsunami 122,
  earthquake 9), and caused about $2.3 billion in property loss (in 2013 dollars; equivalent to $311 million in 1964).
  Earthquake effects were heavy in many towns,
  including Anchorage, Chitina, Glennallen, Homer,
  Hope, Kasilof, Kenai, Kodiak, Moose Pass, Portage,
  Seldovia, Seward, Sterling, Valdez, Wasilla, and
  Whittier.
</p>
<p>
  Anchorage, about 120 kilometers northwest of the
  epicenter, sustained the most severe damage to property.
  About 30 blocks of dwellings and commercial buildings
  were damaged or destroyed in the downtown
  area. The J.C. Penney Company building was damaged
  beyond repair; the Four Seasons apartment
  building, a new six-story structure, collapsed; and
  many other multistory buildings were damaged
  heavily. The schools in Anchorage were almost devastated.
  The Government Hill Grade School, sitting astride a huge
  landslide, was almost a total loss.
  Anchorage High School and Denali Grade School
  were damaged severely. Duration of the shock was
  estimated at 3 minutes.
</p>
<p>
  Landslides in Anchorage caused heavy damage.
  Huge slides occurred in the downtown business
  section, at Government Hill, and at Turnagain Heights.
  The largest and most devastating landslide occurred
  at Turnagain Heights. An area of about 130 acres
  was devastated by displacements that broke the ground
  into many deranged blocks that were
  collapsed and tilted at all angles. This slide destroyed
  about 75 private houses. Water mains and gas,
  sewer, telephone, and electrical systems were
  disrupted throughout the area.
</p>
<p>
  The earthquake was accompanied by vertical
  displacement over an area of about 520,000
  square kilometers. The major area of uplift trended
  northeast from southern
  Kodiak Island to Price William Sound and trended
  east-west to the east of the sound. Vertical displacements
  ranged from about 11.5 meters of uplift to 2.3 meters
  of subsidence relative to sea level. Off the southwest
  end of Montague Island, there was absolute vertical
  displacement of about 13 - 15 meters. Uplift also occurred
  along the extreme southeast coast of Kodiak Island,
  Sitkalidak Island, and over part or all of Sitkinak
  Island. This zone of subsidence covered about
  285,000 square kilometers, including the north and west parts of
  Prince William Sound, the west part of the Chugach
  Mountains, most of Kenai Peninsula, and almost all
  the Kodiak Island group.
</p>
<p>
  This shock generated a tsunami that devastated
  many towns along the Gulf of Alaska, and left serious damage
  at Alberni and Port Alberni, Canada, along
  the West Coast of the United States (15 killed), and
  in Hawaii. The maximum wave height recorded was
  67 meters at Valdez Inlet. Seiche action in rivers, lakes,
  bayous, and protected harbors and waterways along
  the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas caused minor
  damage. It was also recorded on tide gages in Cuba
  and Puerto Rico.

<p>
  This earthquake was felt over a large area of
  Alaska and in parts of western Yukon Territory and
  British Columbia, Canada.
