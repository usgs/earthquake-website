<p>
This earthquake occurred on the
San Andreas fault, which ruptured from near
Parkfield (in the Cholame Valley) almost to
Wrightwood (a distance of about 300 kilometers);
horizontal displacement of as much as 9 meters
was observed on the
Carrizo Plain. It caused one fatality. A comparison of
this shock to the San Francisco earthquake, which
occurred on the San Andreas fault on April 18, 1906,
shows that the fault break in 1906 was longer but
that the maximum and average displacements in 1857 were larger.
</p>
<p>
Property loss was heavy at Fort Tejon, an Army post
about 7 kilometers from the San Andreas fault. Two
buildings were declared unsafe, three others were
damaged extensively but were habitable, and still
others sustained moderate damage. About 20 kilometers
west of Fort Tejon, trees were uprooted, and
buildings were destroyed between Fort Tejon and
Elizabeth Lake. One person was killed in the collapse of
an adobe house at Gorman. Strong shaking lasted
from 1 to 3 minutes.
</p>
<p>
Instances of seiching, fissuring, sandblows and√•
hydrologic changes were reported from Sacramento
to the Colorado River delta. Ground fissures were
observed in the beds of the Los Angeles, Santa Ana,
and Santa Clara Rivers and at Santa Barbara.
Sandblows occurred at Santa Barbara and in the flood
plain of the Santa Clara River. One report describes
sunken trees, possibly associated with liquefaction, in
the area between Stockton and Sacramento.
</p>
<p>
Changes in the flow of streams or springs were
observed in the areas of San Diego, Santa Barbara,
Isabella, and at the south end of San Joaquin Valley.
The waters of the Kern, Lake, Los Angeles, and
Mokulumme Rivers overflowed their banks. Changes
in the flow of water in wells were reported from the
Santa Clara Valley in northern California.
</p>
<p>
Felt from Marysville south to San Diego and east
to Las Vegas, Nevada. Several slight to moderate
foreshocks preceded the main shock by 1 to 9
hours. Many aftershocks occurred, and two (January 9
and 16) were large enough to have been widely felt.
