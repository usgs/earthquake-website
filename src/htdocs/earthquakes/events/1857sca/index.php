<p>
  This earthquake occurred on the
  San Andreas fault, which ruptured from near
  Parkfield (in the Cholame Valley) almost to
  Wrightwood (a distance of about 300 kilometers);
  horizontal displacement of as much as 9 meters
  was observed on the
  Carrizo Plain. It caused one fatality. A comparison of
  this shock to the San Francisco earthquake, which
  occurred on the San Andreas fault on April 18, 1906,
  shows that the fault break in 1906 was longer but
  that the maximum and average displacements in 1857 were larger.
</p>
<p>
  Property loss was heavy at Fort Tejon, an Army post
  about 7 kilometers from the San Andreas fault. Two
  buildings were declared unsafe, three others were
  damaged extensively but were habitable, and still
  others sustained moderate damage. About 20 kilometers
  west of Fort Tejon, trees were uprooted, and
  buildings were destroyed between Fort Tejon and
  Elizabeth Lake. One person was killed in the collapse of
  an adobe house at Gorman. Strong shaking lasted
  from 1 to 3 minutes.
</p>
<p>
  Instances of seiching, fissuring, sandblows and√•
  hydrologic changes were reported from Sacramento
  to the Colorado River delta. Ground fissures were
  observed in the beds of the Los Angeles, Santa Ana,
  and Santa Clara Rivers and at Santa Barbara.
  Sandblows occurred at Santa Barbara and in the flood
  plain of the Santa Clara River. One report describes
  sunken trees, possibly associated with liquefaction, in
  the area between Stockton and Sacramento.
</p>
<p>
  Changes in the flow of streams or springs were
  observed in the areas of San Diego, Santa Barbara,
  Isabella, and at the south end of San Joaquin Valley.
  The waters of the Kern, Lake, Los Angeles, and
  Mokulumme Rivers overflowed their banks. Changes
  in the flow of water in wells were reported from the
  Santa Clara Valley in northern California.
</p>
<p>
  Felt from Marysville south to San Diego and east
  to Las Vegas, Nevada. Several slight to moderate
  foreshocks preceded the main shock by 1 to 9
  hours. Many aftershocks occurred, and two (January 9
  and 16) were large enough to have been widely felt.
