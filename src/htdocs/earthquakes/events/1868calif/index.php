	Because of its location in the heart of the Bay Area, then having a total
	population of about 260,000, and its magnitude, variously estimated as
	between 6.8 and 7.0, this earthquake was one of the most destructive in
	California history. Property loss was extensive and 30 people were killed.

			Earthquake?</h3></a>
			<p>USGS scientists describe the Hayward fault as a tectonic time bomb, due
			anytime for another magnitude 6.8 to 7.0 earthquake. Because such a quake
			could cause hundreds of deaths, leave thousands homeless, and devastate
			the region&rsquo;s economy, the USGS and other organizations are working
			together with new urgency to help prepare Bay Area communities for this
			certain future quake.</p>
