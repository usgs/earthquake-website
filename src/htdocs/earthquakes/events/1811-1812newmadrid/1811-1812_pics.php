  Trees with double sets of roots. Elevated trees left by
  scooping out of sand by overflowing Mississippi waters
  south end of Reelfoot Lake. The surface is now about at
  its original level and the original tree trunk can be seen
  continuing down to the level of the ground.
  Later the tree was buried by sand to a depth of 5 feet and
  new roots formed. Still later the sand was removed.
