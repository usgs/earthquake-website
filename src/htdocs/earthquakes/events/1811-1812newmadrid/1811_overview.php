  Shortly after 2 o'clock on the
  morning of December 16, 1811, the
  Mississippi River valley was convulsed
  by an earthquake so severe
  that it awakened people in cities as
  distant at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,
  and Norfolk, Virginia. This shock
  inaugurated what must have been
  the most frightening sequence of
  earthquakes ever to occur in the
  United States. Intermittent strong
  shaking continued through March
  1812 and aftershocks strong
  enough to be felt occurred through
  the year 1817. The initial earthquake
  of December 16 was followed
  by two other principal
  shocks, one on January 23, 1812,
  and the other on February 7, 1812.
  Judging from newspaper accounts
  of damage to buildings, the February 7
  earthquake was the biggest of the three.
</p>
<p>
  In the Mississippi and Ohio
  River valleys the earthquakes did
  much more than merely awaken
  sleepers. The scene was one of
  devastation in an area which is now
  the southeast part of Missouri,
  the northeast part of Arkansas, the
  southwest part of Kentucky, and
  the northwest part of Tennessee.
  Reelfoot Lake, in the northwest corner
  of Tennessee, stands today as
  evidence of the might of these great
  earthquakes. Stumps of trees killed
  by the sudden submergence of the
  ground can still be seen in Reelfoot Lake.
</p>
<p>
  Uplift of over 3 meters was
  reported at one locality several
  hundred kilometers to the southwest
  of the epicentral zone where a
  lake formed by the St. Francis River
  had its water replaced by sand.
  Numerous dead fish were
  found in the former lake bottom.
  Large fissures, so wide that they
  could not be crossed on horseback,
  were formed in the soft alluvial
  ground. The earthquake made previously
  rich prairie land unfit for
  farming because of deep fissures,
  land subsidence which converted
  good fields to swamps, and numerous
  sand blows which covered the
  ground with sand and mud. The
  heavy damage inflicted on the land
  by these earthquakes led Congress
  to pass in 1815 the first disaster relief
  act providing the landowners of
  ravaged ground with an equal
  amount of land in unaffected regions.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the most dramatic effects
  of the earthquakes occurred
  along rivers. Entire islands
  disappeared, banks caved into the rivers,
  and fissures opened and closed
  in the river beds. Water spouting
  from these fissures produced large
  waves in the river. New sections
  of river channel were formed and old
  channels cut off. Many boats
  were capsized and an unknown
  number of people were drowned.
  There are some graphic eyewitness
  descriptions in contemporary newspapers
  made by the boatmen caught on
  the Mississippi River near Little
  Prairie, not far from the present-day
  town of Caruthersville, Missouri.
</p>
<p>
  Although the total number of
  deaths resulting from the earthquakes
  is unknown, the toll probably
  was not large because the area
  was sparsely populated and because
  the log cabin type construction that
  was prevalent at that time withstood
  the shaking very well. Masonry and
  stone structures did not fare so well,
  however, and damage to them
  was reported at distances of 250
  kilometers and more. Chimneys
  were thrown down in Louisville,
  Kentucky, about 400 kilometers
  from the epicentral area, and were
  damaged at distances of 600 kilometers.
</p>
<p>
  Although it is impossible to
  know the precise epicentral coordinates
  of the earthquakes, contemporary
  accounts of the events suggest
  that the epicenter of the
  December 16 shock was close to the
  southern limit of the area of
  sand blows. The epicenter of the
  February 7 shock was closer to
  the northern limit of the sand blows,
  near the town of New Madrid, Missouri.
  There is not sufficient information
  about the second main shock
  on January 23 to know its epicenter.
  Thus the common practice
  of calling the entire earthquake
  sequence the ``New Madrid earthquakes''
  is somewhat misleading.
  From what is known about the
  present seismicity of the area, it can
  be inferred that their focal depths
  were probably between 5 and 20 kilometers.
  The fault plane -- or planes --
  on which the Earth rupture
  occurred are inferred to have had a
  NNE - SSW strike direction, more
  or less parallel to the Mississippi River.
</p>
<p>
  The felt areas of the three
  largest earthquakes were extremely
  large. They extended south to the
  gulf coast, southeast to the Atlantic
  coast, and northeast to Quebec,
  Canada. The western boundary
  cannot be established owing to a
  lack of population. However, it can
  be estimated that the area of intensity V
  or greater effects was approximately
  2&frac12; million square kilometers.
  This can be contrasted
  with the 1906 San Francisco earthquake,
  for which the area of intensity V
  or greater effects was about
  150,000 square kilometers. The
  large difference in felt areas
  between the Mississippi Valley and
  San Francisco earthquakes, which
  had approximately the same magnitude
  and focal depth, can be explained
  by differences in attenuation
  of earthquake waves traveling
  through the Earth's outer crust.
  The crust in the Western United States
  tends to ``soak up'' earthquake
  energy, whereas in the central and eastern
  regions of the
  country the seismic energy experiences
  a much lower rate of absorption.
  Quantitative studies of recent earthquakes
  confirm this explanation.
</p>
<p>
  Invariably the three questions
  that are asked when one describes
  the 1811-12 earthquakes are
  (1) could such earthquakes occur again,
  (2) if so, when will they happen,
  and (3) what would be the effect
  of such an earthquake if it were to
  occur now?
</p>
<p>
  The answer to whether such
  earthquakes can happen again is
  yes. Field studies by M. L. Fuller
  of the United States Geological Survey
  published in 1912, provided topographic
  and geological evidence of
  large magnitude earthquakes predating
  the 1811-12 sequence. This
  evidence included ground cracks as
  large as any caused by the 1811-12
  earthquakes in which trees fully
  200 years old grew from the bottoms
  and slopes. Indications of
  more recent faults and of sandstone
  dikes filling old earthquake cracks
  were also found by Fuller. Futhermore,
  studies of the seismicity since
  1812 show that the region is behaving
  in a manner more or less typical
  of active seismic zones.
</p>
<p>
  The second question -- when
  will another great earthquake happen --
  is much more difficult to answer.
  Extrapolation of magnitude
  and intensity recurrence curves is
  presently the only method of prediction
  available, but this is full of
  difficulties because the earthquake
  record covers far too brief a period
  of time and because earthquakes do
  not follow an exact cyclical pattern.
  Although extrapolations of recurrence
  curves for the region indicate
  return periods -- depending on the
  investigator -- of anywhere between
  about 400 to 1,000 years for an
  earthquake the size of the December 16,
  1811 event, there is a possibility
  that such an earthquake
  might occur as soon as next year or
  as late as several thousand years
  hence.
</p>
<p>
  It is easier to speculate on the
  effects that an earthquake the size
  of the 1811-12 series would have if
  it were to occur today than it is to
  predict when it will happen. In the
  epicentral area, a repeat of the kind
  of surficial damage experienced in
  1811-12 can expected. However,
  this would result in a much
  greater loss of life and property
  today because of the much larger
  number of people and man-made
  structures in the region than were
  there 162 years ago. Even more
  awesome is the size of the area that would
  be affected. The dispersion
  of the surface waves, combined
  with their low attenuation, would
  result in a large amplitude, long
  duration sinusoidal type of motion
  with periods in the same range as
  the natural periods of tall buildings.
  Although damage to buildings located outside
  of the immediate
  earthquake zone would be mostly
  nonstructural in character, the monetary
  amount should be expected to be very large. The
  emotional and psychological effects of a large
  earthquake in the central part of the
  country would probably also be
  considerable, particularly if the
  earthquake had a long aftershock
  pattern as the 1811-12 sequence did.
</p>
<p>
  Perhaps the greatest danger of
  all arises from the sense of complacency,
  or perhaps total ignorance,
  about the potential threat of a large
  earthquake. The frequency of occurrence
  of earthquakes the size of
  those that took place in 1811-12 is
  very low; however, continuing
  minor to moderate seismic activity
  in the central Mississippi Valley
  area is an indication that a large
  magnitude tremor can someday be
  expected there again.
