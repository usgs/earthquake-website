          <h3>Instructions</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Download and install <a href="http://earth.google.com">Google Earth</a>. We recommend using the latest version.</li>
            <li>Uncheck (turn off) any layers that may be active within the left panel, <em>Places</em> and <em>Layers</em>. To provide a 3D perspective, turn on the Terrain layer under <em>Layers</em> or on the <em>Navigation Panel</em>.</li>
            <li>Begin the 1906 Earthquake Virtual Tour by stepping through the chapters beginning with <a href="global.php">Global Geologic Setting of the 1906 Earthquake</a>. Within each chapter you will find layers (in KMZ format) to load into Google Earth. After clicking the download link, open the file in Google Earth.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Tips</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>To avoid confusion</strong>, turn off previous layers before downloading a new layer into Google Earth. After examining the feature of interest, you may then turn on and off layers as you desire.</li>
            <li><strong>To increase performance</strong>, delete layers after you have examined them to satisfaction. Performance of your computer may decrease upon loading multiple files into Google Earth.</li>
            <li>Many of the features on the map are clickable and contain more information or links to additional information.</li>
          </ol>
