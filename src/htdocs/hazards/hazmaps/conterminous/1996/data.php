<p>
  Data files are presented in two formats, text and binary. Both formats for a given file contain the same information. The text file is white-space delimited and can easily be imported into your favorite spreadsheet application (i.e. Microsoft Excelâ„¢) for further analysis. The binary format is more useful for programatic access from custom pieces of software.

<p>
  In addition to the output data files below we also make available to you the catalog data used when performing our analysis.
