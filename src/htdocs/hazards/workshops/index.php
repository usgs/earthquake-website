<h2 id='disclaimer'>Disclaimer</h2>

<p class='alert'>
  The U.S. Geological Survey produces National Seismic Hazard Maps that are the basis of seismic provisions of building design codes, earthquake insurance rate structures, and other public policy decision-making tools. Because of the significant safety and financial implications of these maps, they are held to a high level of scrutiny by earthquake engineering and science experts. The National Seismic Hazard Mapping Project, which has responsibility for the maps, has undertaken an extensive process to update these maps. We hold regional and topical open workshops across the country to solicit new information, to discuss potential changes, and to build consensus on the best available science. Workshop participants are welcome to show any information relevant to the topic of seismic hazard in the United States. The workshop presentations inform the community of the current methods, models, and data that are being considered in the update and provide credit to the presenters for their contributions. Moreover, these presentations are important in describing the current state of practice and in providing a historical context of prevalent thoughts of the hazard community at the time the maps were developed. However, all of the information shown at the workshop is pre-decisional, and not all of the information has been published or even reviewed. It is important for individuals accessing the workshop section of this website to understand that the workshop information is not endorsed by the USGS. A similar disclaimer also applies to un-reviewed USGS presentations that typically display impacts of a suite of alternative weighted-models on the seismic hazard maps. These presentations are shown for informational purposed only; the models shown in the presentations will not necessarily be included in the final maps. Final hazard maps will rely on published information, and the documentation will be published as a USGS Open-file report and as journal articles.
