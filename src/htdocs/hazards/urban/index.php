    </a>
    <p>
      The liquefaction hazard map
      predicts the approximate percentage of each designated area that will have
      surface manifestations of liquefaction during an M7.1 earthquake on the
      Hayward fault. An earthquake of this magnitude is expected if the whole
      Hayward fault ruptures in a single event (Working Group on California
      Earthquake Probabilities, 1999). This event dominates the deaggregated
      hazard near the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay.

    </a>
    <p>
      Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee, is located where damaging earthquakes
      are only moderately likely, but the consequences of earthquakes, mainly
      from the New Madrid seismic zone, can be very high. This densely populated
      urban area is built on a 1-kilometer-thick sequence of sediments deposited
      in a trough known as the Mississippi embayment. This thick pile of
      sediments significantly affects earthquake ground motions. We, the
      authors, have generated a suite of seismic hazard maps for a
      six-quadrangle area in Memphis, Shelby County, Tennessee, that accounts
      for these effects. These maps and their derivative products represent the
      collaborative efforts of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and its
      partners.

    </a>
    <p>
      The USGS has produced a new series
      of earthquake hazard maps for the City of Seattle. These &ldquo;urban
      seismic hazard&rdquo; maps provide a much higher-resolution view of the
      potential for strong earthquake shaking than previously available. This
      new view is particularly important for Seattle, which sits atop a
      sedimentary basin that strongly affects the patterns of earthquake ground
      shaking and therefore, of potential damage.
