  The regional maps available here are derived in much the same way
  as the urban seismic hazard maps,
  with both including the effects of shallow geologic structure on estimated ground shaking.&nbsp;
  The regional maps show the varying levels of ground shaking expected for specific hypothetical
  or 'scenario' earthquakes, both in terms of ground
  <a href="/learning/glossary.php?term=acceleration">accelerations</a> and their effects measured
  in <a href="/learning/glossary.php?term=intensity">'intensity'</a> units.
  The calculations underlying these regional maps employ the same methodology and
  input information as in the national and urban seismic hazard maps, except
  for the shallow geologic structure and the specific parameters describing each earthquake.
  The sources of the geologic information are provided below and each map lists
  the earthquake parameters specific to that map.
