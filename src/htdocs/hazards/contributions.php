<p>
  The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) will update the National Seismic Hazard Model (NSHM) twice over the six years since its 2014 update. The two updates will be submitted for publication in mid-2018 and early-2020, in order to facilitate potential incorporation into the next edition of the NEHRP Recommended Seismic Provisions for New Building and Other Structures.
</p>
<p>
With this memo, the USGS requests that the earthquake hazard community bring to our attention new earthquake source and ground motion data or models that could be included in the NSHM updates, at the discretion of the USGS. The sooner such data and models are brought to our attention, the more likely it is that we can include them, resources permitting.
</p>
<p>
<strong>For the 2018 NSHM update, only peer-reviewed data and models published (or accepted for publication) by March of 2017 will be considered; likewise, the 2020 NSHMP update will only consider peer-reviewed data and models published by May of 2018.</strong>

Please bring the new earthquake source and ground motion data or models to our attention by emailing <a href="mailto:mpetersen@usgs.gov?cc=nluco@usgs.gov&&subject=NSHM Contributions">Mark Petersen with cc to Nicolas Luco</a>. Mark Petersen will reply to confirm receipt and request additional information.
</p>
