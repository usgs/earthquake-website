      The mission of the Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory (ASL) is to support the operation and maintenance of seismic networks. As part of this mission, the ASL is responsible for the USGS-portion of the Global Seismographic Network (GSN) and the ANSS backbone network. The ASL also runs the ANSS depot, a facility to support ANSS networks and maintains an instrument facility for the development, testing, and evaluation of seismological equipment. ASL staff are based in Albuquerque, NM, and Golden, CO.
		</p>
    <p>
    The ASL has a small outreach program.  As part of this program, ASL staff host tours at the ASL, visit classrooms in the Albuquerque area, participate in festivities such as the New Mexico State Fair, and support IRIS/USGS earthquake displays at the Smithsonian Institution, the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, the Carnegie Institution, IRIS Headquarters in Washington, DC, and USGS Headquarters in Reston, Virginia.

          The Albuquerque Seismological Laboratory (ASL) was established in 1961 as a quiet site for testing seismometers for the WWSSN, but quickly became the installation and maintenance depot and data collection center as well.
