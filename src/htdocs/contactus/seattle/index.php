			The spectacular scenery of the Pacific Northwest results directly from the
			active geological processes associated with being part of a subduction
			zone. The Pacific Northwest includes Washington, Oregon, northern
			California, and southwestern British Columbia, and geologically shares many
			similarities with the subduction zones of Japan and Chile. Instrumental,
			written, and geological records from the region tell of earthquakes from
			three generalized sources. Earthquakes as large as magnitude 7 originate in
			the subducted Juan de Fuca plate, mainly beneath the Puget Sound region.
			Moderate and large earthquakes occur also on faults within the overriding
			North America plate, on both sides of the Cascades. Great earthquakes, as
			large as magnitude 9, happen on the boundary between these plates.
			Earthquakes from any of these sources may set off landslides, liquefaction,
			and tsunamis.
		</p>
		<p>
			USGS earthquake studies of this region are intended to help reduce the losses
			earthquakes may cause. Activities include collaboration with the University of
			Washington in contributing to the Advanced National Seismic System through
			operation of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network.
