<h2>About the NEIC</h2>

<p>
The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC),
was established in Rockville, Maryland, in 1966 as part
of the National Ocean Survey of the Department of Commerce.
The Coast and Geodetic Survey, a forerunner of the National Ocean Survey,
had coordinated the collection of seismological data
in the United States for many years.
The NEIC was transferred to Boulder, Colorado,
in 1972 and made part of the U.S. Geological Survey in 1973.
The NEIC was moved again in 1974 to its present location
in Golden, Colorado.
</p>
<p>
The National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC),
a part of the Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey,
is located in Golden, Colorado, 10 miles west of Denver.
The NEIC has three main missions.
First, the NEIC determines, as rapidly and as accurately as possible,
the location and size of all significant earthquakes that occur worldwide.
The NEIC disseminates  this information immediately to concerned national
and international agencies, scientists, critical facilities, and the general public.
Second, the NEIC collects and provides to scientists and to the public an
extensive seismic database that serves as a solid foundation
for scientific research, principally through the operation
of modern digital national and global seismograph networks
and through cooperative international agreements.
The NEIC is <i>the</i> national data center and archive
for earthquake information.
Third, the NEIC pursues an active research program
to improve its ability to locate earthquakes and
to understand the earthquake mechanism.
These efforts are all aimed at mitigating the risks
of earthquakes to mankind;
and they are made possible by the fine international cooperation
that has long characterized the science of seismology.
</p>

</p>
<p>
The NEIC operates a 24-hour-a-day service
to determine the location and magnitude
of significant earthquakes in the United States
and around the world as rapidly and accurately as possible.
This information is communicated to federal and state government agencies
who are responsible for emergency response,
to government public information channels,
to national and international news media,
to scientific groups (including groups planning aftershock studies),
and to private citizens who request information.
When a damaging earthquake occurs in a foreign country,
the earthquake information is passed to the staffs
of the American embassies and consulates in the affected countries
and to the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA).
The NEIC issues rapid reports for those earthquakes with magnitudes
at least 3.0 in the eastern United States,
3.0 in the western United States,
or 5.0 (or are known to have caused damage)
anywhere else in the world.
At the present time, the NEIC staff locates and publishes
approximately 30,000 earthquakes on a yearly basis.
These are the most important of the many million earthquakes
which are estimated to occur each year.

<p>
The NEIC collects data through the operation of national and global networks,
and through cooperative agreements.
To enable the detection and location
of all felt earthquakes with the U.S.,
the NEIC
acts as the National Operations Center
of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS),
a cooperative venture between the
NEIC and the operators of the regional seismic networks
across the United States.
The NEIC also relies on the cooperation
of a variety of seismic reporting networks
throughout the world to gather data.


The NEIC also collects non-instrumental reports of the effects
of earthquakes on people and man-made structures
and prepares isoseismal maps showing the distribution
of intensities in widely felt or damaging shocks.
</p>
<p>
The data that are collected by the NEIC are published
in a variety of formats and publications
and are available electronically via the Internet.
The "Quick Epicenter Determinations" (QED),
a very preliminary list of earthquakes,
is computed daily.
The "Preliminary Determination of Epicenters" (PDE)
is published weekly and monthly.


The "Earthquake Data Report" (EDR),
also a monthly publication, provides additional and
more detailed information, mainly for the use
of seismologists.
</p>
<p>
A wide range of research is also conducted at the NEIC.
Investigations range from resolving the internal structure
of the Earth and understanding the mechanics of earthquake rupture
through rapid assessment of an earthquake's impact.
These research efforts are intended to improve the data service
provided by the NEIC to the scientific community
and the general public;
and, ultimately, to aid in earthquake hazard mitigation.
