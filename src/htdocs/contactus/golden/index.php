      The Geologic Hazards Science Center (GHSC), on the Colorado School of Mines
      campus, is home to the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), as well
      as the Geomagnetism Program staff, and many scientists in the Landslide
      Hazards Program. The Global Seismographic Network (GSN) is also operated
      nearby in Albuquerque, NM.     </p> The mission of the National Earthquake
      Information Center (NEIC) is to determine rapidly the location and size of
      all destructive earthquakes worldwide and to immediately disseminate this
      information to concerned national and international agencies, scientists, and
      the general public. The NEIC compiles and maintains an extensive, global
      seismic database on earthquake parameters and their effects that serves as a
      solid foundation for basic and applied earth science research.     </p>
