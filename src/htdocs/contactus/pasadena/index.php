      The Pasadena USGS Office conducts research and promotes activities to reduce earthquake
      hazards in southern California. The Office works with Caltech and the California
      Geological Survey (CGS) operating the Southern California Seismic Network, and also
      operates GPS stations, to monitor earthquake activity, to continuously monitor crustal
      movements, and to provide information for earthquake response.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Office also collaborates on projects with the Southern California Earthquake Center
      (SCEC), including research as well as Outreach &amp; Education.

          USGS handbooks that describe the threat posed by earthquakes in Southern
          California and explain how you can prepare for, survive, and recover from
          these inevitable events.

          Millions of people worldwide practice how to Drop, Cover, and Hold On each October during Great ShakeOut Earthquake Drills, which began in southern California in 2008.

        </a>
        <p>
          USGS geologists are working to characterize the behavior of major faults
          in Southern California.  This research includes trenching faults to uncover
          evidence of earthquakes that occurred hundreds to thousands of years in the
          past and mapping surface rupture features following major earthquakes.

        <img src="images/pas-shakealert-2x.jpg" alt="screenshot of ShakeAlert prototype" width="150"/>
      </a>
        <p>
          The objective of earthquake early warning is to rapidly detect the
          initiation of an earthquake and issue a warning before the seismic waves
          reach a populated area.  The USGS and its partners are working to bring
          earthquake early warning to the West Coast.

        </a>
        <p>
          Long-term estimates of seismic hazard are needed to set building codes and
          earthquake insurance rates.  We are working to improve these hazard models
          and estimate shorter-term probabilities such as aftershock forecasts.

    <!-- Earthquake Ground Motion -->

          <h4>Earthquake Ground Motion</h4>
          <img src="images/pas-northridgesm-2x.jpg" alt="Northridge ShakeMap" width="150"/>
        </a>
        <p>
          The shaking felt during an earthquake is a combination of many factors,
          including earthquake size, the structure of the Earthâ€™s crust, and local
          soil behavior.  By better understanding the ground motions that would be
          produced in a large earthquake, we can engineer a more resilient urban
          environment.

        <p>
          The SAFRR project is working to build resilience to natural hazards such as
          earthquakes, floods, wildfires, landslides, tsunamis, and coastal erosion by
          working with decision making and emergency response efforts across the nation.
