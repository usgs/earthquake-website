This page contains snapshots of the video clips from a
computer simulation of ground shaking from the 1906 earthquake
with annotations of some of the key scientific
features. Teachers can use the video clips in their classroom
to help teach about seismic waves and earthquake hazards.

<h2>Concepts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Earthquakes begin at a point (known as the "epicenter," when
    viewed on a map).
  </li>
  <li>
    A long section of a fault can rupture during an earthquake,
    progressively expanding away from the epicenter. The rupture
    may grow for a few seconds to up to a minute depending on
    the size of the event.
  </li>
  <li>
    The earth shakes in all different directions and modes
    during an earthquake.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Scientists categorize these different modes of shaking
        into different groups called "P-waves," "S-waves," and
        "surface waves."
      </li>
      <li>
        Different groups of waves travel through the earth at
        different speeds, with P-waves moving fastest, then
        S-waves, and finally surface waves.
      </li>
      <li>A single earthquake generates all these types of waves.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The intensity of shaking you experience depends on the
    <ul>
      <li>
        amount of energy released by the earthquake (measured by
        its magnitude, and related to the distance the fault
        slips during the earthquake)
      </li>
      <li>distance you are from the fault</li>
      <li>type of soil or rock underneath you.</li>
</ul>
  </li>
</ul>

      <p>
        Because the animations are so rich with teachable
        information, we recommend that you use them to motivate
        a more detailed investigation. The USGS collaborated
        with educational institutions to put a free curriculum
        for teaching earthquake hazards on the web (including
        lesson plans with hands on activities, teacher
        background, and assessment examples). To download a free
        copy of the curriculum now, visit the <a
        href="http://teachingboxes.org/earthquakes">Living in
        Earthquake Country Teaching Box</a>.
      </p>

<p>
  The following instructions outline a more abbreviated use of
  the movies in your classroom.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Give some <a
    href="/earthquakes/events/1906calif/18april/">background on the 1906 earthquake</a>. Share stories and photos of
    the damage caused by this earthquake.
</li>
<li>
    Inform students that they will be learning about seismic
    waves and earthquake damage. You will be showing a movie of
    the shaking during the earthquake at different
    points in the San Francisco Bay Area. Scientists measure
    the intensity of the shaking and record it on a specific scale (in
    this case, the modified Mercalli scale). It is not necessary
    to discuss the details of this scale before viewing the
    movie, but it can serve as a tie to existing curriculum
    requirements. (Optional <a
    href="http://teachingboxes.org/earthquakes/lessons/lesson5_activity2.jsp">background
    lesson on intensity</a>.)
</li>
<li>
    Show the movie of shaking intensity [<a

    ].  <ol>
<li>
      Before hitting play, point out the land, water, San
      Andreas fault, and cities familiar to them. Also discuss the
      color scale of shaking intensity. Ask them to predict how
      high they think this earthquake reached on the color
      bar. Take votes, asking a few students why they chose
      their number.
    </li>
    <li>
      Play the movie completely through once.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask students what they observed and what they liked about it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Repeat the movie, but this time pause several times to
      point out key features. If your movie player does not have
      a pause button, hitting the space-bar often pauses the
      movie. Hit it again to resume the movie. The timeline
      below has specific snapshots of the movie at specific
      times with annotations so that you can point various
      features out. We recommend that you play the movie 3
      additional times:
      <ul>
  <li>
          Once to discuss the growth of the rupture from
          epicenter to termination.<br /> (Related <a

</figure>

<p>
  <b>About the Epicenter</b>: Earthquake starts at 0 seconds as
  a tiny patch of the fault begins to slip. We call the location
  where the rupture begins the "epicenter" when viewed on a
  map. The fault actually begins to slip deep below the earth
  (about 10 km or 6 miles deep for the 1906 earthquake), and
  seismologists call this point below the surface the
  "hypocenter" (sometimes referred to as the "focus" in
  textbooks).
</p>
<p>
  <b>About Seismic Waves</b>: Both P and S waves are generated
  immediately and start radiating outward from the earthquake
  starting point like ripples moving out from a stone dropped
  into a pond. Earthquakes typically release less energy in
  P-waves than in S-waves, so the P-waves cause less intense
  shaking than S-waves. In this movie, the initial <font
  color="#69b3b6">P-waves</font> show up as <font
  color="#69b3b6">light blue</font> colors and <font
  color="#fca63f">S-waves</font> cause the more intense <font
  color="#fca63f">yellow-orange</font> colors to appear. Because
  P-waves travel fastest, they are the first to reach the beach
  in San Francisco. The S-waves are not far behind but don't
  appear on the map at 1.7 seconds because they are still
  traveling from the hypocenter at 10 km depth towards the
  surface, while the speedy P-waves have already emerged.
</p>

<h3 class="clear">2.6 seconds</h3>

  <figcaption>Move your mouse over image to see the annotations.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  <b>About Seismic Waves</b>: S-waves are now visible, but they
  lag behind the P-waves because they travel slower. The
  <font color="#69b3b6">blue</font> and <font
  color="#fca63f">yellow-orange</font> circles in the annotated
  image outline the very first P- and S-waves emitted from the
  hypocenter.
</p>
<p>
  <b>About Fault Rupture</b>: Earthquakes are often shown as a
  single dot at their epicenter, but in fact there is movement
  along an entire, long section of the fault. For the 1906
  earthquake, the San Andreas slipped over a 480-km-long section
  (300 miles) from Mendocino down to San Juan Bautista! Not all
  of the fault moves at once, however. Instead, the fault starts
  to "unzip," with the rupture growing and spreading out away
  from the hypocenter.  The thick red line in the center of the
  annotated image shows the portion of the fault that has
  slipped thus far. In the movie, watch as the 1906 earthquake
  spreads out in both directions away from the epicenter. Some
  earthquakes only grow in one direction because a portion of
  the fault might be stronger and stay locked together,
  preventing the rupture from extending in both directions.
</p>

<h3 class="clear">3.4 seconds</h3>

    <figcaption>Move your mouse over image to see the annotations.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  <b>About Shaking Intensity</b>: Shaking intensity is strongest
  close to the fault and dies off with distance away from the
  fault. Because only a small section of fault has slipped in
  the first 3.4 seconds, the pattern looks a lot like a bullseye
  centered around the short section of fault that has slipped so
  far (indicated by the thick red line in the annotations). As
  the fault rupture grows over time, the bullseye will
  start to elongate parallel to the fault to a more football
  shaped pattern. For example, watch the shaking intensity near
  San Mateo over time. Even though it is far from the epicenter,
  it is still close a portion of the fault that eventually
  ruptures. The same is true for all of Marin county, to the
  left (northwest) of the epicenter.
</p>


<h3 class="clear">6.2 seconds</h3>

<figcaption>Move your mouse over image to see the annotations.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  <b>About Seismic Waves</b>: Seismic waves are generated at
  every point along the fault as that portion of the fault
  ruptures. The thin lines in the annotations show the P- and
  S-waves generated early in the earthquake (e.g., at the
  epicenter). They continue to spread out like ripples on a
  pond. If the earthquake only emitted P-waves and S-waves at
  the beginning of the earthquake, the ripples would be perfect
  circles about the epicenter. However, additional shaking
  energy is added at the tips of the rupture, indicated by the
  thicker circles. The final, football-shaped pattern you see is
  the combination of a whole bunch of ripples generated in
  succession along the fault (like throwing a bunch of stones
  into the pond one after the other in a line along the fault).
  This is why shaking is intense all along the fault and not
  just near the epicenter.
</p>
<p>
  Surface waves travel slower than P- or S-waves. They are
  difficult to see directly in this movie because they are mixed
  together with some of the S-waves.
</p>

<h3 class="clear">16 seconds</h3>

  <img src="./1906/images/sf1906t0160.jpg" alt="image depicting earthquake at 16 seconds" class=rollover />
    <figcaption>Move your mouse over image to see the annotations.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  <b>About Seismic Waves</b>: Like a track and field race where
  one runner is faster than the other, the P-waves keep getting
  further and further ahead of the S-waves so that the distance
  between them gets greater as time goes on. Also, the shape of
  the wave fronts (thin lines in annotations) is not perfectly
  smooth. This is because seismic waves travel at different
  speeds through different types of rock. P-waves are always
  faster than S-waves, but all the waves get slowed down in some
  materials. Think of this as the difference between running on
  a smooth track (hard rock, like granite) versus thick mud
  (loose, poorly compacted sediments and soils).
</p>
<p>
  <b>About Shaking Intensity</b>: Near Tomales Bay, the dark
  colors indicate extremely strong shaking. In this case, the
  intensity is due to the fact that in the 1906 earthquake more
  energy was released in that section of the fault than along
  any other stretch. Different portions of the fault can move
  different amounts in the same earthquake. Here, the two sides
  of the fault slid more than 30 feet, while the slip at the
  epicenter was only about 12 feet (<a href="slipmodel.php">See
  a map of how much the fault slipped</a>). The epicenter only
  indicates where shaking starts -- not where shaking is most
  severe. The huge amount of movement near Tomales Bay released
  a huge amount of seismic energy, resulting in violent
  shaking.
</p>

    <figcaption>Move your mouse over image to see the annotations.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  <b>About Shaking Intensity</b>: Seismic waves dissipate as
  they travel through the earth, so shaking is usually most
  severe closest to the fault. However, some types of rock and
  soil amplify shaking for the communities built on top of
  them. An excellent example is the city of Santa Rosa, which
  experienced very serious damage in 1906 (Download a
  classic photo of the <a
  href="./images/santarosacityhall.jpg">destroyed city hall</a>. When these soft
  soils extend deep down and are surrounded by harder rocks (a
  "sedimentary basin"), the waves get trapped and slosh around
  like waves in a bathtub, making shaking last longer and damage
  more severe. The dark red colors reflect the strong shaking in
  the soft Santa Rosa basin. A similar effect is visible in a
  valley above Richmond in the image.
</p>
<p>
  This computer simulation does not include the shallowest layer
  of soils such as Bay muds that surround the margin of the San
  Francisco Bay (because our computers are not yet big and fast
  enough to handle these small features). The actual observed
  shaking was much more severe around the Bay than these
  simulations show. Take a closer look at the <a
  href="/earthquakes/events/1906calif/shakemap/">actual
  shaking intensity on the Bay margins during 1906</a>.
</p>
<p>
  See a 3-D perspective movie with a closeup of Santa Rosa,
  below.
</p>

<h3 class="clear">After 30 seconds</h3>

<p>
  <b>About Fault Rupture</b>: The rupture for the 1906
  earthquake continues to expand along the fault for 54 seconds
  to the south and 90 seconds to the north. It stops when it
  hits a section of the fault that is strong enough to stop the
  rupture. That section will eventually need to slip in future
  earthquakes. Smaller magnitude earthquakes sooner, before the
  rupture has propagated very far. Scientists are still trying
  to learn more about what causes ruptures to stop, so they
  don't fully understand why some earthquakes are big and some
  are small.
</p>
<p>
  <b>About Shaking Intensity</b>: Shaking at any given location
  can continue for a long time for two reasons:
 <ul>
    <li>
      Waves continue to arrive from distant parts of the
      fault. Because these waves travel so far, these are less
      intense by the time they arrive.
    </li>
    <li>
      Seismic waves trapped in sedimentary basins continue to
      slosh around like waves in a bathtub.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Both of these effects diminish with time, but they can still
  cause damage to structures that were weakened by earlier
  intense shaking.

<p>
  See the comments for the image of the shaking map from 2.6
  seconds that discusses the length of a fault rupture. This
  video clip shows the earthquake rupture running through
  Tomales Bay. The dark black blob along the fault shows the
  part of the fault that is actually slipping at each point in
  time. The deformation is exaggerated by a factor of 1000
  causing the appearance that the fault opens and closes during
  the shaking. Notice the small peninsula in the middle of the
  image moves toward you as a result of slip on the fault. This
  peninsula moved 15 feet in the earthquake, so without the
  exaggerated deformation it remains attached to the mainland.

<p>
  See the comments for the image of the shaking map from 30
  seconds that discusses basin effects. Santa Rosa is an
  excellent example where you can watch the region slosh around
  long after the main shaking passes.
</p>
<p>
  Which way do the waves appear to come from? They start coming
  directly from the epicenter (top center of image), but by
  20-25 seconds, they are coming from the right part of the
  frame and by 43 seconds they seem to come in from far to the
  right (far north). This change reflects the continuing growth
  of the rupture. The later waves come from the newest part of
  the rupture further to the north as the fault progressively
  "unzips" northward. This pattern of incoming waves is
  complicated by the sloshing around of waves within the
  sedimentary basin.
</p>
<p>
  Compare the Santa Rosa basin, below, to Tomales Bay. How long
  does the shaking last at each location? Watch the motion of
  the land and not the colors. Both experience extremely strong
  shaking (dark red colors), but the duration of shaking differs
  at the two sites. While Tomales Bay does continue to move a
  little after the rupture passes, it does not slosh and jiggle
  like the Santa Rosa basin because the underlying rock is more
  rigid in Tomales Bay.

<p>
  By focusing on a specific spot in the closeup movies, you can
  observe the wide range of shaking motions characteristic of
  the different wave categories, such as S- and surface
  waves. Even though the motion is exaggerated by a factor of
  1000, the P-wave motions are still too small to see in these
  movies.
</p>
<p>
  Using the movie below, we have highlighted a specific location
  where different wave motions are most apparent. While we
  provide specific details for features to look for below, it
  may be difficult for students to see them. The main goal is to
  recognize that there are a variety of directions of motions,
  and this variety is due in part to the different types of
  waves. A secondary goal is to recognize how waves arrive from
  different directions over time associated with rupture from
  different parts of the fault.
</p>
<p>
  Surface waves are easiest to recognize in the movie. There are
  two primary categories of surface waves, Rayleigh waves and
  Love waves (<a
  href="http://www.dac.neu.edu/physics/b.maheswaran/phy1121/data/ch14/anim/anim1403.htm">simple
  animation with background information</a>). Seismologists
  break surface waves into these categories because they move at
  different speeds through the earth and the direction of motion
  is different between them. The video clip of Livermore basin
  illustrates some of these differences. Show the following
  video clip several times, asking students to observe the small
  hills shown in the black box below labeled "Watch here." Try
  to observe which direction that spot moves at different points
  in the movie (e.g., up and down, side-to-side, back-and-forth,
  etc...). The differences are subtle and go by quickly, but
  it's an interesting illustration for older students with keen
  observation skills. It may be best to advance through the
  movie frame by frame so that the movie goes more
  slowly. Compare the motions to the <a

</table>
<p>
<sup>*</sup>The times listed above are for the very first time
that you can notice the waves arriving of the given
category. However, waves and energy continue to arrive for a
long time from more distant sections of the rupture. We list
very precise times for the P- and S-wave arrivals but less
precise times for the surface waves. This is because the surface
waves are mixed in with later-arriving S-waves and share many
features in common with them. It can sometimes be difficult to
distinguish between the these categories of waves. The wave
velocities calculated in the table are slower than the velocity
you would measure if you could recognize the more subtle earlier
arrivals of the same categories of waves. This exercise could be
done more precisely using individual seismograms recorded by
sensitive instruments (rather than by eye from a video).
</p>


<h3 style="clear: left;">Activity: Calculating Wave Velocities</h3>

<p>
  The box labeled "Watch here" is about 66.9 kilometers (45.6
  miles) from the earthquake epicenter. Calculate the speed of
  each type of wave by the following process (answers in table
  above):
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Record the precise time when each wave arrives. This is
    easiest for P- and S-waves, which are recognized by the
    change in colors.
  </li>
  <li>
    Convert the distances and times to the desired units. Your
    measured time is in seconds. If using meters per second,
    convert the distance into meters. If using miles per hour,
    convert the time into hours (should be a small fraction of
    an hour).
  </li>
  <li>
    Distance = Velocity * Time. So, calculate the velocity by
    dividing the distance by the time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider the meaning of these numbers. A person walks
    about 1 m/s and a bullet travels about 1000 m/s (~2200
    mph). These waves are literally "faster than a speeding
    bullet!."
  </li>

    How much warning time would you have of approaching strong
    S-wave shaking if you lived 10 km from the epicenter of a
    large earthquake? 50 km? 100 km? [<a

    warning</a>]

</ul>
<p>
  To calculate these velocities, you have to assume that the
  waves you see were generated at time 'zero', which means that
  they are coming directly from the earthquake epicenter and not
  from other parts of the earthquake rupture. Is this a good
  assumption? (Not really -- waves are generated along the
  entire length of the rupture, so their "starting time" will
  vary. Seismologists use computer simulations, such as the ones
  shown here, to understand the details of this complex
  shaking.)
