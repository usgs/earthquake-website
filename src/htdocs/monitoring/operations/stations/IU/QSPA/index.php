  <h3>Vault Condition</h3>
  <p>Surface instruments are in a 8ft diameter cylindrical vault with the floor of the vault ~4 m below the surface of the snow. Borehole instruments are in ~12&quot; diameter holes at depths of 275m (KS54000) and 255m (Guralp). Boreholes are dry and not cased and are in solid ice. Boreholes will slowly collapse, but the strength of the downhole instruments are designed to withstand the hydrostatic load.</p>
