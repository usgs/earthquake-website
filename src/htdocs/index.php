      The USGS Earthquake Hazards Program is part of the
      <a href="http://www.nehrp.gov/" target="_blank">National Earthquake
      Hazards Reduction Program</a> (NEHRP), established by Congress in 1977.
      We monitor and report earthquakes, assess earthquake impacts and hazards,
      and research the causes and effects of earthquake.
