    <p>
      A swarm of earthquakes in a sparsely populated area of far northwest
      Nevada that began on July 12, 2014, has increased in intensity over the
      past several days. This activity is located about 40 miles southeast of
      Lakeview, OR, and 40 miles northeast of Cedarville, CA.

    <p>
      Thirty seismometers are being installed in the Nationâ€™s capital this
      winter to monitor ground tremors to better estimate the intensity of
      ground shaking that can be expected during future earthquakes in the area.
