  <h2>Studies Forecasting Moderate Earthquake Near Parkfield, Calif. Receive Official
    Endorsement </h2>
  <h3>The forecast that an earthquake of magnitude 5.5 to 6 is likely to occur
      in the Parkfield, Calif. area within the next several years (1985 - 1993)
      has been reviewed and accepted by state and federal evaluation panels according
      to an announcement today (April 5, 1985) by the U.S. Geological Survey.</h3>
    <p> A letter summarizing the results of the scientific review of the Parkfield
  forecast was sent to Mr. William Medugovich, Director the California Office
  of Emergency Services, by Dr. Dallas Peck, Director of the U.S. Geological Survey. </p>
    <p>Parkfield has been the site of a USGS earthquake prediction experiment that
  is using sophisticated distance measuring devices and other monitoring equipment
  in an attempt to determine and monitor signals that might presage an earthquake. </p>
    <p>The research that led to today's statement has been carried out by William
  H. Bakun and Allan G. Lindh of the U.S. Geologcial Survey and Thomas v. McEvilly
  of the University of California. Their conclusions are based on analyses of
  reports of earthquakes in the Parkfield area in 1857, 1881, and 1901 and seismograph
  records of events near Parkfield in 1922, 1934 and 1966. The average interval
  between these events is 22 years and statistical analyses indicate a high probability
  (over 90 percent) of another earthquake in the region within in the 1985-1993
  interval. The seismograph records of the last three Parkfield earthquakes are
  very similar, leading to the hypothesis of a characteristic earthquake in the
  Parkfield region of about magnitude 6 on the Richter Scale. </p>
    <p>Parkfield is along the San Andreas fault in a sparsely populated region about
  170 miles south of San Francisco and 180 miles north of Los Angeles. An earthquake
  of magnitude 6 is of moderate size, at the threshold of being able to cause
  modest damage to some structures that have not been designed for earthquake
  resistance. </p>
    <p>The last characteristic Parkfield earthquake occurred on June 28, 1966, registered
  a magnitude slightly less than 6, and caused only minor damage to wood-frame
  houses in the region. </p>
    <p>The results of the Parkfield studies by Bakun, Lindh, and McEvilly have recently
  been reviewed and endorsed by the National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation
  Council and the California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council. These bodies
  advise federal and state officials respectively on the validity of statements
  and studies regarding the occurrence of future earthquakes. The national council
  concluded that the findings at Parkfield constitute a long-term prediction,
  a term adopted by both councils to describe a statement on the occurrence of
  an earthquake at a specific place and within a time interval of a few years
  to a few decades. </p>
    <p>In their evaluation of research, the two prediction review panels said that
  the potential exists for the next earthquake in the Parkfield region to be larger
  than the 1966 shock, and for the fault rupture to extend southeast into the
  adjacent 25-miles segment of the San Andreas fault. Both panels agreed, however
  the evidence for this larger earthquake was speculative and required additional
  data and review. </p>
    <p>Under a program of earthquake prediction research, the US Geological Survey
  maintains an array of sensitive geophysical monitoring instruments in the Parkfield
  region in an attempt to predict the occurrence of the expected earthquake more
  precisely. The California Division of Mines and Geology also maintains a large
  number of instruments to measure the effects of the earthquake. </p>
    <p>The California Office of Emergency Services has reviewed the evaluation with
  local officials and will take coordinated action should extensive monitoring
  equipment arrayed throughout the Parkfield region indicate that the anticipated
  earthquake is imminent. </p>
