<caption><p><a name="creep"></a>* The status levels get down-graded if it has been raining
  in the week prior to the candidate creep event unless signals can be confirmed
  with additional data. Either seismicity or creep can meet the spcific status
  criteria. If both creep and seismicity meet their specifed criteria for a status
  level, then the status level is increased to the next level. (ie, If both seismicity
  and creep meet status level "C", the level is increased to a status level "B".)
  There are other instruments that have athreshold for status level D. </p></caption>
<caption><p><a name="prob"></a>+ Seismicity status probabilities are based on statistical
  models of foreshock behavior. For the other networks (such as creep) probabilities
  are based on anomalies about as unusual as the stated earthquakes, but the data
  are insufficient to support a formal statistical analysis.</p></caption>

      section northwest of Middle Mtn. to the simplier section southeast of Cholame.
