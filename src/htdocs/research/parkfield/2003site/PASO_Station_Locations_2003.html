<h2>Parkfield Area Seismic Observatory (PASO) Station Locations (from Steve Roecker)</h2>
  <p>Below is a table of PASO stations that Cliff Thurber and Steve Roecker reoccupied in October - November 2003. </p>
<p>Latitudes and longitudes are in the WGS84 reference frame; coordinates are also given in the UTM projection, North American Datum 1927 (NAD27).  These tables also include station locations in the "local tomography" frame, defined with the origin at the SAFOD Pilot Hole drill site and rotated so that positive Y is 140 degrees east of north and positive X is 50 degrees east of north.</p>
  <p>All elevations have been determined from the NED 30 meter DEM for this area using the program Steve Rocker put on his <a href="http://gretchen.geo.rpi.edu/roecker/paso/proj/proj.html">web site</a> EXCEPT for HRSN stations (because they are in boreholes, so the DEM does not apply directly).</p>  <p>Below are locations and shot times for our shots (a total of 58).</p>
