<h2>Fault-Zone Trapped Wave Experiment at the SAF, Parkfield</h2>
<h3>Locations of 44 Stations In Seismic Arrays Near SAFOD Drilling Site<br />
October 18 - November 29, 2003 (from Yong-Gang Li)</h3>
  <p>These are revised coordinates (as of 2/19/04) for the 44 Li/Vidale fault zone guided wave array stations.</p>
  <p>For maximum accuracy, the latitudes and longitudes shown below are based on measurements of station spacing and alignment in the field relative to Catchings et al stations. (These Catchings et al. stations were located using Trond Ryberg's Trimble differential GPS system, and are used as the fundamental datum for lat/long values given below.)</p>
  <p>For 26 stations of the total 44 FZ stations shown below, elevations were determined by adding a geoid correction (from the National Geodetic Survey [NGS] web site) to the Height Above Ellipsoid (HAE) values from the Trimble differential GPS reading obtained at co-located Catchings et al. stations (i.e., stations located within 1 m of those listed below). For the non-co-located stations (6 stations NE11-16 of the cross-fault array and 12 stations NW1-8 and SE1-5 of the along-fault array) elevations were determined by adding the NGS geoid correction to the WGS84 HAE values from the internal REFTEK GPS receiver (using PASSCAL program logpeek).  These REFTEK GPS data were acquired over observation periods ranging from 1 week to 40 days.  To estimate the accuracy of these REFTEK-derived elevations, we compared HAE values from the 26 co-located stations for which elevations were determined both by the Trimble differential GPS system and the internal REFTEK GPS.  This comparison showed that these HAE values differed by ~0.5 m to ~8 m, with an average discrepancy of 3.5 m.</p>
  <p>As an additional check on station elevations, Steve Roecker estimated elevations for each of the stations, below, through interpolation of the latest USGS Digital Elevation Model.  His DEM elevations differed from those shown below (Li - Roecker elevations) by values ranging from -4.3 to 14.8 m, with an average difference of 2.8 m.</p>
