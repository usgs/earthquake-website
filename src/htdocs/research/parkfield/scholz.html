<p>In February 1995, the National Academy of Sciences sponsored a colloquium,
  &quot;Earthquake Prediction: The Scientific Challenge,&quot; in Irvine, Calif.
  The proceedings, which were published in April 1996, will make bemusing reading
  for anyone not intimately familiar with the long and checkered history of this
  topic (Proceedings of The National Academy of Science, v. 93, no. 9). With several
  notable exceptions, the contributions consisted of theoretical papers that dealt
  primarily with the earthquake mechanism and only incidentally, if at all, with
  the problem of earthquake prediction. As a collection, the volume succeeds admirably
  in talking around its subject. </p>
<p>If there is a scientific challenge to earthquake prediction, this group of illuminati
  appeared unwilling to admit much of a clue as to how to go about meeting it.
  Academy colloquia are usually organized to showcase new and exciting developments
  in science, but this one was more a wake than a celebration: the participants
  seemed more embarrassed than enthused with their topic. All of which leads one
  to wonder, &quot;Whatever happened to earthquake prediction?&quot; </p>
<h3>High Hopes in the 1970's</h3>
<p>The heyday of scientific cockiness on the predictability of earthquakes was
  in the '70s. In 1973, I and my colleagues Lynn Sykes and Yash Aggarwal put forward
  the dilatancy-diffusion theory in an attempt to explain a great variety of phenomena
  that had been observed to shortly precede earthquakes. These phenomena were
  actually precursory, said the theory, and therefore could be used to predict
  the earthquake.  This development was ballyhooed, both by the global media and in the  scientific  literature, as signaling the advent of practical earthquake prediction. To  raise  the level of clamor yet higher, the Chinese government announced in 1975 that
  it had successfully predicted a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, and that the city
  of Haicheng had been evacuated in advance, saving thousands of lives. </p>
<p> The euphoria, however, was short-lived. In 1976, a U.S. team visited China to
  investigate the Haicheng prediction. They found that the prediction was apparently
  the result of an unusually pronounced foreshock sequence coinciding with a sort
  of widespread public hysteria associated with a Cultural Revolution declaration
  that earthquake prediction could be accomplished through the unfailing efforts
  of the &quot;broad masses of the people.&quot; However one judged the merits
  of this prediction, it did not lead to any method that could be translated into
  western scientific practice. To cement this disillusionment, the famously unpredicted
  and disastrous Tangshan earthquake struck, killing 250,000 people in northern
  China in 1976.</p>
<p> In the meantime, back in California, several tests were made to detect one of
  the precursors predicted by the dilatancy-diffusion theory. These tests which
  were made on magnitude 5-ish earthquakes and were carried out, in my view, rather
  desultorily - produced negative results. Though none too conclusive, these results
  were accepted by consensus as deeming the failure of both the theory and of
  that particular form of earthquake precursor, neither of which has been seriously
  investigated since.
</p><h3>A Tradition of Suspicion</h3>
<p>The ready, even eager, acceptance of these negative conclusions reflects the
  fact that the western scientific community has never viewed earthquake prediction
  with anything shy of extreme suspicion, if not doctrinaire disbelief. This view
  is typified, if somewhat brusquely, by the late Charles E Richter, the curmudgeonly
  doyen of American earthquake seismology, who was fond of saying, &quot;Bah,
  no one but fools and charlatans try to predict earthquakes!&quot; (Although
  this statement is often quoted as apocryphal, I actually once overheard Richter
  make this declaration to a TV reporter.)</p>
<p> This assertion, of course, conveys more than mere skepticism, for it states
  that earthquake prediction is not a valid topic for scientific investigation.
  It perhaps reflects a reaction to the long struggle in the West, still very
  much alive in some quarters, between scientific and religious authority. The
  prediction of earthquakes, long the province of the occult, is for that reason
  alone beyond the pale of respectable scientific study.</p>
<p> To be sure, Richter had a point: the subject does attract all manner of self-proclaimed
  oracles. Some, like Jim Bergland, the San Jose man who for several years in
  the '8Os kept the media entranced with his predictions based on fluctuations
  in the number of missing dog and cat notices in local newspapers, are simply
  amusing - unless you happen to be the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) spokesperson
  repeatedly called upon to debunk them. Somewhat more annoying are cases like
  that of Iben Browning, who provoked a nationwide media frenzy several years
  ago with his prediction of an earthquake in New Madrid, Mo. </p>
<p> The really serious cases, though, are those that involve scientists - cases
  that often become causes c&eacute;l&egrave;bres. A current dispute of this type
  concerns the VAN method, named eponymously for its creators, Varotsos, Alexopoulos,
  and Nomicos, three physicists who since 1982 have been claiming successful predictions
  of earthquakes in Greece based on electrical signals. The validity of their
  claims and methodology has been hotly contested; the debate occupies an entire
  recent issue of Geophysical Research Letters (v. 23, no. 11, 1996).</p>
<h3>Government Take Up The Challenge </h3>
<p>The events of the '70s were not without long-range consequences. It was in
  this heady atmosphere that the U.S. Congress enacted the National Earthquake
  Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) in 1977. In Japan, a fledgling earthquake
  prediction program, which had been limping along since 1965, saw its budget
  double in 1974 and continue to grow rapidly thereafter. Suddenly there were
  national programs in the two leading earthquake-science countries, and both
  had a component featuring earthquake prediction, although the focus was very
  different in the two cases.
  NEHRP a multi-agency effort involving the USGS, National Science Foundation,
  and Federal Emergency Management Agency, became (and continues to be) the mainstay
  of earthquake studies in the United States. It focuses on both prediction and
  mitigation, and includes both earthquake engineering and earthquake science,
  broadly based.</p>
<p> The prediction component of NEHRP always emphasized the research nature of this
  endeavor and was never a major activity. At its peak, prediction studies accounted
  for no more than 20 percent of the USGS-administered part of the program, and
  this share gradually decreased. During the early years of NEHRP there was a
  sizable group of independent prediction researchers, both inside and outside
  of the USGS, but their numbers dwindled over time, due to the unusually severe
  peer criticism applied to this particular line of research. Eventually, virtually
  all prediction work became concentrated in one officially sanctioned activity
  the Parkfield Prediction Experiment.</p>
<p> Predicting earthquakes is as easy as one-two-three. Step 1: Deploy your precursor
  detection instruments at the site of the coming earthquake. Step 2: Detect and
  recognize the precursors. Step 3: Get all your colleagues to agree and then
  publicly predict the earthquake through approved channels.</p>
<p> Bill Bakun, Al Lindh, and their colleagues at the USGS thought that they had
  figured out at least the premise to Step 1, namely where an earthquake was going
  to happen in the near future. A section of the San Andreas Fault near the hamlet
  of Parkfield in central California had ruptured in magnitude 6 earthquakes six
  times since 1857 with an average repeat time of 22 years; the last quake had
  occurred in 1966. Assuming a plausible hypothesis for the recurrence of these
  events, the USGS scientists estimated (at a 95-percent confidence level) that
  the next Parkfield earthquake would occur before January 1993. Thus, in 1984
  the Parkfield Prediction Experiment was launched.</p>
<p> An incredible array of instrumentation was assembled in the Parkfield area:
  dense seismic and geodetic networks, and instruments for measuring water level,
  electrical resistivity, magnetic fields, and geochemical precursors. This effort
  was a real-time experiment, so all the data had to be telemetered to the USGS
  in Menlo Park and analyzed by computer in near real time.</p>
<p> Anticipating Step 3, protocols were prearranged in which different combinations
  of precursors would lead automatically to different alert levels, which in turn
  would lead to a schedule of notification scenarios. Key personnel were put on
  a round-the-clock beeper roster. Now all they had to do was wait for the precursors
  to roll in.
  While the US earthquake program focused mainly on mitigation, the Japanese program
  became entirely a prediction program. By 1978 it was no longer called a research
  program, and had become committed to predicting a magnitude 8 earthquake in
  a highly populated and developed part of the country - the Tokai district on
  Suruga Bay, west of Tokyo. </p>
<p> The rationale for the selection of this particular site was similar to that
  for Parkfield, but for the Japanese, the stakes were immensely greater. Not
  only had the Japanese public been convinced that earthquake prediction was possible,
  but the consequences of failing to predict such a potentially disastrous earthquake
  were huge. Moreover, as Tokyo University's Bob Geller complained, the Japanese
  were putting all their eggs into one basket, neglecting the mitigation and earthquake
  engineering side of earthquake studies, as well as other areas of potential
  risk. </p>
<h3>Opportunity Lost </h3>
<p>The long-term forecasts that led to the selection of the Tokai and Parkfield
  sites for short-term prediction experiments are the other side of the earthquake
  prediction coin. Long-term forecasting is a much better posed scientific problem,
  and is the basis for earthquake hazard analysis. It has its roots in H.F. Reid's
  corollary to his elastic rebound theory: the next earthquake is likely to happen
  when the strain released in the previous one has been restored. </p>
<p> The application of this principle led to the long-term forecast of the Loma
  Prieta (World Series) earthquake of 1989. In a USGS open-file report in 1983,
  Al Lindh pointed out that the southernmost part of the rupture zone of the 1906
  San Francisco earthquake had slipped much less than points to the north and
  thus had a high probability of rupturing within the next few decades. Lynn Sykes
  and Stu Nishenko further refined this forecast in 1984, and I weighed in with
  further analysis in 1985; these subsequent forecasts appeared in refereed journals.
  I stated that the imminence of this sector (Loma Prieta) was greater than any
  part of the San Andreas except Parkfield. </p>
<p> In the last few years before the earthquake occurred, this issue was debated
  before several forums, and the USGS was urged to instrument the area for detecting
  precursors. Dissenting opinion within the USGS and organizational inertia prevented
  any action. Aside from electromagnetic signals picked up by Stanford's A.C.
  Fraser-Smith, who had been serendipitously operating a ULF receiver in the vicinity,
  no precursors were detected for the Loma Prieta earthquake, for no instruments
  had been deployed, and a great opportunity was lost.</p>
<h3>What Became of the Predictions? </h3>
<p>Meanwhile, 1993 has come and gone at Parkfield with no earthquake, while two
  other damaging earthquakes have struck in California, both on little-known faults
  in the south. The error in the Parkfield timetable has been explained in two
  ways. Jim Savage of the USGS has argued that the original premise was fallacious,
  since it only considered a single, non-unique recurrence scenario. On the other
  hand, Steve Miller of UTH Zurich has suggested that a nearby thrust earthquake
  in Coalinga in 1983 reset the clock at Parkfield. Whatever the explanation for
  the tardiness of the next Parkfield earthquake, the wait goes on. </p>
<p>The 1995 Kobe
  earthquake disaster has given the Japanese a much bigger hangover, exposing
  the lopsidedness of their program. Not only did their much vaunted earthquake-resistant
  construction prove fallible, but the emergency response to the earthquake was
  scandalous - the relief corps did not enter the city until almost 10 hours after
  the earthquake. </p>
<p>Kobe was not an unexpected place for such a disaster to occur.
  In 1981, the causative fault of the Kobe earthquake had been designated by geologists
  as one of 12 &quot;precautionary&quot; faults in Japan - active faults in a
  late stage of their seismic cycle. The trouble is, slow moving intraplate faults
  like Kobe and the faults that caused the Landers and Northridge earthquakes
  in southern California have earthquake recurrence times of thousands of years,
  so even very good long-range forecasts for such faults would have very large
  uncertainties in human time scales. </p>
<p>In contrast, it is possible to estimate
  earthquake probabilities on a time scale of decades for rapidly moving faults
  like the San Andreas, where recurrence times are about every 100 years. Such
  estimates have been made for all of the main faults of the San Andreas system.
  This procedure has clear social benefits, for it shows us where to concentrate
  mitigation efforts, such as retrofitting substandard buildings and emergency
  planning. </p>
<p>So where are we with short-term prediction? The Kobe earthquake was
  found retrospectively to have been preceded by a host of precursors, as pointed
  out by Paul Silver and Hiroshi Wakita in the July 5, 1996, issue of Science
  (v. 273, p. 77). There is no doubt in my mind that many earthquakes are preceded
  by real precursors, but their causative processes remain murky, mainly because
  we lack good observations. Whether or not we can ever follow the three-step
  procedure necessary to predict earthquakes from such precursors is an open question.
  But for me, the scientific challenge in earthquake prediction lies in understanding
  the mechanisms behind those precursory phenomena.</p>
