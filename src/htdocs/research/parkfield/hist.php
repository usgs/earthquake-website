      <figcaption>Significant earthquakes have occurred on the Parkfield
      section of the San Andreas fault at fairly regular intervals
      - in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934 and 1966. The next significant
      earthquake was anticipated to take place within the time
      frame 1988 to 1993.</figcaption>

      <p>Moderate-size earthquakes have occurred on the Parkfield
  section of the San Andreas fault at fairly regular intervals
  - in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934 and 1966. While little is
  known about the first three shocks, available data suggest
  that all six earthquakes may
    have been &quot;characteristic&quot; in the
  sense that they occurred with some regularity (mean repetition
  time of about 22 year) and may have repeatedly ruptured the
  same area on the fault. (see <a href="/research/parkfield/scientific.php#Bakun95">Bakun
    and Lindh, 1985</a> and <a href="/research/parkfield/scientific.php#Bakun95">Bakun
      and McEvilly, 1979</a>) </p>
      <p>The similarity of waveforms recorded in the 1922, 1934 and
  1966 events, shown below, is possible only if the ruptured
  area of the fault is virtually the same for all three events.</p>

      <figcaption>Recordings of the east-west component of motion made
      by Galitzin instruments at DeBilt, the Netherlands. Recordings
      from the 1922 earthquake (shown in black) and the 1934
      and 1966 events at Parkfield (shown in red) are strikingly
      similar, suggesting virtually identical ruptures. </figcaption>
