The hypocenter files used in the 3d aplet are the "name.3d" files

To make a name.3d file from a hypocenter file:
     make3d hypocenter_file

The result will be returned as "hypocenter_file.3d"

The script "make3d" runs a script on pwave which, in turn, runs a BATCH Splus run. Its a bit of a Rube Goldberg, but it works.  

Currently, the only hypocenter file format allowed is the Double Difference format. Should be easy to allow hypoinverse files.
