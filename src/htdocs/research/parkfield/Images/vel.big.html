      and (b) southeast-northwest (B-B') and (c) southwest-northeast (A-A') cross 
      sections. Velocity color scale is shown in lower right. magnetic body modeled 
      by R.C. Jachens (USGS) is indicated by thickness contour lines (km) in (a). 
      MM, Middle Mountain; GH, Gold Hill; CL, Coalinga epicenter; KH, kettleman 
      Hills epicenter. In cross sections, SAF, San Andreas fault; CA, Coalinga 
      Anticline. Asterisks in (c) show hypocenters of the 1966 Parkfield and 1984 
      Coalinga earthquakes. (d) Resistivity model computed by S.D. Stanley (USGS), 
      usiing magnetotelluric data in a 2-D inversion. Triangles indicate observations
