<h2>The Parkfield, California, Earthquake Prediction Experiment</h2>
<h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>Five moderate (magnitude 6) earthquakes with similar features have occurred
  on the Parkfield section of the San Andreas fault in central California since
  1857. The next moderate Parkfield earthquake is expected to occur before 1993.
  The Parkfield prediction experiment is designed to monitor the details of the
  final stages of the earthquake preparation process; observations and reports
  of seismicity and aseismic slip associated with the last moderate Parkfield
  earthquake in 1966 constitute much of the basis of the design of the experiment.</p>
<p>Certain sections of the San Andreas fault system in central California tend
  to fail in recurring, moderate-sized (magnitude 5 to 7), characteristic earthquakes
  (1, 2). Characteristic earthquakes are repeat earthquakes that have the same
  faulting mechanism, magnitude, rupture length, location, and, in some cases,
  the same epicenter and direction of rupture propagation as earlier shocks. The
  earth- quakes in 1979 at Coyote Lake and in 1984 at Morgan Hill, both of magnitude
  6 (Fig. 1, inset), on the southern Calaveras fault east of San Jose, California,
  are recent examples of characteristic earthquakes, apparently repeating shocks
  in 1897 and 1911, respectively (3, 4). The case for characteristic earthquakes
  on the Parkfield section of the San Andreas fault (Fig. 1) is more complete
  (5), at least in part because the interval between events at Parkfield is shorter
  (21 to 22 years) than the interval (70 to 85 years) that is apparently appropriate
  for the southern Calaveras fault (3, 4).</p>
<p>In recent years, earthquakes near Parkfield (Fig. 1) have occurred either on
  the San Andreas fault or in distinct clusters of activity near the western edge
  of the San Joaquin Valley (6). Northwest of the Parkfield section, slip on the
  San Andreas fault occurs predominantly as aseismic fault creep; although small
  shocks (magnitude &lt;4) occur here frequently, shocks of magnitude 6 and larger
  are unknown and little, if any, strain is accumulating (7). In contrast, very
  few microearthquakes and no aseismic slip have been observed on the fault south-
  east of Cholame; this locked section apparently ruptures exclusively in large
  earthquakes (magnitude &gt; 7) , most recently during the great Fort Tejon earthquake
  of 1857 (8). Parkfield earthquakes occur within the transition zone between
  these contrasting modes of fault failure. The regular nature of Parkfield seismicity
  since 1857 may be due to the nearly constant slip rate pattern on the adjoining
  sections of fault. Until recently, the Parkfield section had been relatively
  free of significant perturbations in stress caused by nearby shocks; the effect
  of the 2 May 1983 Coalinga earthquake [local magnitude (<em>M</em><sub>L</sub>)
  6.7], 40 km northeast of Parkfield (Fig. 1), on the timing of the next Parkfield
  shock is not known.</p>

      1983 Coalinga earthquake, which cover the Coalinga area when plotted.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>Historic Parkfield Seismicity </h3>
<p>The epicenters of two foreshocks of magnitude 6 in 1857, as well as the epicenter
  of the 1857 main shock, were probably located on the San Andreas fault near
  Parkfield (9). Since 1857, earthquake sequences with main shocks of magnitude
  6 have occurred near Park- field on 2 February 1881, 3 March 1901, 10 March
  1922, 8 June 1934, and 28 June 1966. The times between sequences since 1857
  are remarkably uniform, with a mean interval of 21.9 &plusmn; 3.1 (standard
  deviation of the mean) years (Fig. 2b). Although the time of the 1934 sequence
  departs from the regular pattern by occurring a decade too early, the time of
  the 1966 sequence conforms to the regular pattern, in that the 44 years between
  1922 and 1966 is twice the mean interval. The last damaging Parkfield earthquake
  in 1966 was assigned a value for <em>M</em><sub>L</sub> of 5.6 (5, 10) and a seismic moment of 1.4
  x 1025 dyne-cm (1 1). Although the shock might have caused significant damage
  if it had occurred in a metropolitan area, it caused only minor damage to the
  wooden frame homes in the sparsely populated Parkfield region (12, 13). The
  source of the 1966 earthquake can be described by a simple model: unilateral
  rupture propagation southeast over the rupture zone, a 20- to 25-km-long section
  of the San Andreas fault bounded by two geometric discontinuities in the fault
  trace that apparently control the extent of rupture (14). The northwest discontinuity,
  adjacent to the epicenter of the 1966 main shock on Middle Mountain, is a 5&deg;
  change in the strike of the fault trace; the southeast discontinuity is a l-km
  echelon offset (right step) in the fault trace near Gold Hill. The Parkfield
  preparation zone is the 1- to 2-km-long section of fault at the northwest end
  of the rupture zone; the preparation zone is defined to include the 5&deg; bend
  in the fault trace and the epicenters of the 1966 main shock and its foreshock
  (<em>M</em><sub>L</sub> 5.1) (Fig. 1).</p>
<h3>The Characteristic Parkfield Earthquake</h3>
<p>The 1934 and 1966 Parkfield sequences were remarkably similar (5, 10). The
  main shocks had identical epicenters, magnitudes, fault-plane solutions, and
  unilateral ruptures. Moreover, identical foreshocks of M<sub>L</sub> 5.1 preceded each
  main shock by 17 minutes (10), and the lateral extent of aftershock epicenters
  in 1966 (15) repeated that in 1934 (16). The location and extent of surface
  faulting in 1934 were similar to those in 1966, and anecdotal reports suggest
  that, after the 1922 and 1901 events, cracks were found in some of the same
  places as well ( 12). Intensity patterns for the Parkfield shocks in 1901, 1922,
  1934, and 1966 are similar (9); the few reports available for the 1881 Parkfield
  shock (17) are consistent with the intensities reported for the more recent
  shocks. The epicentral location of the main shock in 1922 is constrained to
  the 18-km-long section of the fault northwest of the rupture zone (18). Comparisons
  of seismograms for the 1922, 1934, and 1966 main shocks recorded in Europe,
  North America, and South America suggest that, within the experimental errors
  of 10 to 20 percent, the seismic moments for the three shocks were equal (5). </p>
<p>Although few data are available for Parkfield sequences before 1934, they are
  consistent with the proposal that the main shocks in 1881, 1901, and 1922 were
  similar to those in 1934 and 1966 (5). The similarities in the main shocks (19)
  suggest that the Parkfield section of the San Andreas fault is characterized
  by recurring earthquakes with predictable features. Thus, the design of a prediction
  experiment can be tailored to the specific features of the recurring characteristic
  earthquake.</p>
<h3>A Recurrence Model for Parkfield Earthquakes</h3>
<p> The limited data available on the recurrence of large and great earthquakes
  along plate boundaries around the world apparently are consistent with a time-predictable
  model, for which the time interval between successive shocks is proportional
  to the coseismic displacement of the preceding earthquake (20, 21). Unfortunately
  this simple model is not supported by the data available for the last three
  Parkfield earthquakes: although comparable coseismic displacements in 1922,
  1934, and 1966 are inferred from the observations (5), the time intervals between
  the three events differ by more than a factor of 2 [ 1934 to 1922 (12 years)
  compared with 1966 to 1934 (32 years)]. </p>
<p> However, simple adjustments result in another model, the Parkfield recurrence
  model, which partially accounts for the timing of the characteristic Parkfield
  shocks (see Fig. 2a). Both models assume a constant loading rate and an upper
  bound stress threshold, <font face="Symbol"> <font face="Symbol">s</font></font><sub>1</sub>,
  corresponding to the failure strength, or yield stress, of the fault. Whereas
  the time-predictable model permits a variable stress drop, the Parkfield recurrence
  model assumes the same stress drop for each characteristic earthquake but allows
  for the possibility of an occasional early failure, that is, before <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>1</sub> is reached. The Parkfield recurrence model implies that the stress drop in a
  characteristic earthquake generally does not completely relieve stress in the
  rupture zone. </p>
<p> The features of the Parkfield recurrence model are easily described. Failure
  at or near <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>1</sub> corresponds to those times when the failure stress is approached
  over the entire rupture zone, at which time failure must occur; according to
  this model there can be no late characteristic Parkfield earthquakes. However,
  triggering scenarios (22) can be devised that permit the occasional early characteristic
  earthquake. </p>

        rate of 2.8 cm per year and a coseismic slip of 60 cm for the Parkfield
        earthquake sequences in 1881, 1901,1922,1934, and 1966 are assumed (56).

        The line represents the linear regression of the time of the sequence

        (that is, the next) Parkfield sequence for the regression is January 1988.
        (c) Shocks of M<sub>L</sub> greater than 4 since 1930 have tended
        to occur when the stress exceeds <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>2 </sub>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> There may be evidence for an early triggering mechanism in the seismicity
  preceding the 1934 event. The foreshocks during the 3 days before the main shock
  in 1934 were initiated by a cluster of magnitude 3 events and a subsequent shock
  of <em>M</em><sub>L</sub> 5.0 (23). This early <em>M</em><sub>L</sub> 5 foreshock,
  which occurred 55 hours before the 1934 main event and about 3 km northwest
  (16), was characterized by unilateral rupture expansion southeast toward the
  preparation zone (24), a particularly efficient mechanism for increasing right-lateral
  shear stress in the preparation zone. This early foreshock may have triggered
  the failure within the preparation zone, including the immediate foreshock of <em>M</em><sub>L</sub> 5.1 and the main shock (25). The Parkfield area was relatively
  quiet ~ for shocks of <em>M</em><sub>L</sub> 4 or greater in the years following
  the 1934 and 1966 sequences (Fig. 2c); more active periods began in 1953 and
  1975. This pattern is reminiscent of the seismic cycle modulations in regional
  seismicity that accompany great plate-boundary earthquakes (26). Perhaps there
  is an intermediate stress level ,<font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>2</sub>,
  reached midway in the recurrence cycle (27), at which moderate seismicity (M
  ~ 4) resumes in the Parkfield area. The 1934 Parkfield sequence occurred approximately
  when <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>2</sub> would have been reached (Fig. 2). We can speculate that, while the early foreshock
  in 1934 should have just marked the onset of the active half of the seismic
  cycle, it triggered a sequence of shocks near the preparation zone that culminated
  in the immediate foreshock and the 1934 characteristic earthquake. According
  to the model, the next characteristic Parkfield earthquake should occur before <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>1</sub>is
  exceeded (early 1988 from Fig. 2). The uncertainty in this predicted time can
  be estimated from the regression of times of characteristic earthquakes that
  we presume occurred at <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>1</sub>(28).
  From the relation T<sub>o</sub> = 21.71 + 1836.2 (line in Fig. 2b), where T<sub>o</sub> is the time of origin (in years) and <em>1</em> is a characteristic earthquake
  counter (5), the 95 percent confidence interval for the predicted date is 1988.0
  &plusmn; 5.2 (29). That is, the next characteristic Parkfield earthquake should
  occur be fore 1993. </p>
<h3> Recent Seismicity</h3>
<p> The significant recent seismic activity on the San Andreas fault near Parkfield
  is concentrated near the ends of the 1966 rupture zone (Figs. 1 and 3), the
  same spatial pattern that preceded the 1979 Coyote Lake and 1984 Morgan Hill
  earthquakes (3, 30). Seismic activity on the creeping section northwest of the
  preparation zone is characterized by shallow focal depths and a small average
  magnitude, which are typical features of seismicity along the creeping section
  of the fault northwest to San Juan Bautista (31). The recent seismicity within
  the rupture zone mimics the spatial and magnitude distributions of the 1966
  aftershocks (32), even though the events shown in Figs. 1 and 3 occurred well
  after the end of the 1966 aftershock activity (33). Apparently, the distribution
  of seismicity within the rupture zone is controlled by relatively stationary
  fault zone properties, such as geometry (30, 34) or rock type (35). </p>
<p> The seismic activity near the preparation zone (36) is most critical for short-term
  earthquake prediction. All but one of the M ~ 4 shocks in the Parkfield area
  since 1969 have occurred within 1 to 2 km of the preparation zone. On 13 September
  1975, a shock of <em>M</em><sub>L</sub> 4.9 with low static stress drop (24) occurred
  5 km northwest of the preparation zone; rupture propagated southeast, apparently
  stopping near the preparation zone. This shock appears to be similar in many
  respects to the early foreshock in 1934 (and to the shock of M L 5 on 16 November
  1956) (24), but it did not trigger an early characteristic earthquake, although
  it did initiate the current active phase of the seismic cycle (Fig. 2c). Since
  1975, a number of clusters of magnitude 3 shocks, the most recent in June 1982,
  have occurred near the preparation zone. </p>
<p> The static stress drops of the immediate foreshocks of <em>M</em><sub>L</sub> 5.1 in 1934 and
  1966 were marginally higher than those of other shocks of M L 5 located near,
  but not within, the preparation zone (24). Higher static stress drops were also
  obtained for a set of recent smaller shocks located close to the preparation
  zone ; sources of lower stress drop tend to occur around the sources of higher
  stress drop (37). Perhaps the preparation zone is characterized by sources of
  relatively high stress drop, whether or not the
  earthquakes are foreshocks. </p>
<p> Signals from seismographs (38) near Parkfield (Fig. 4) are telemetered continuously
  to a central data-processing facility in Menlo Park, California. The signals
  are automatically and continuously monitored by a real-time processor (39) that,
  within a few minutes, routinely locates earthquakes in central California. Beeper
  and paging systems have been established so that the responsible scientists
  are notified within minutes of all significant seismicity near the preparation
  zone. </p>
<h3>Crustal Deformation</h3>
<figure class="right" style="max-width: 310px"><a href="/research/parkfield/Bakun85_Fig3.html" title="Click for larger image" rel="ibox&amp;width=650&amp;height=425"><img src="/research/parkfield/Images/Bakun85_Fig3_sm.gif"  alt="Cross section of the seismicity for 1975-1984 along the section

<figcaption>Fig. 3. Cross section of the seismicity for 1975-1984 along the section
      A-A' (Fig. 1) of the San Andreas fault. Relative focal depths are generally
      accurate to 1 km or less; depths of the shallow shocks northwest of the
      preparation zone are less accurate, with an uncertainty of about 2 km. For
      reference, the hypocenters of the immediate foreshock of <em>M</em><sub>L</sub> 5.1 and the main shock in 1966 are shown as small and large stars, respectively,
      and the approximate outline of the 1966 aftershock zone (rupture zone) is
      dashed.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p> An irrigation pipeline that crosses the rupture zone 2 km northwest of Gold
  Hill broke and separated about 9 hours before the 1966 Parkfield main shock
  (40). Also, fresh en echelon cracks of uncertain origin were observed in the
  fault zone near the center of the rupture zone 12 days before the 1966 earthquake;
  if the cracks were tectonic, they resulted from aseismic slip in the rupture
  zone (41). An optimistic interpretation of the broken pipeline and the fresh
  cracks is that a few centimeters or more of precursory fault creep occurred
  in the rupture zone just before the 1966 earthquake. Although these observations
  are fragmentary, and although subsequent earthquakes elsewhere in California
  have not produced any further evidence for premonitory slip, laboratory observations
  and theoretical calculations (42) indicate that premonitory deformation should
  occur near the hypocenter, although the amount and timing are uncertain. In
  light of the crucial importance of this question for future directions in earthquake
  prediction research, a major effort has been undertaken at Parkfield to define
  whatever premonitory deformation precedes the next earthquake there. </p>
<p>On a more fundamental basis, the deformation measurements define the tectonic
  framework within which all the Parkfield observations must be interpreted. The
  Parkfield section of the San Andreas fault is a relatively simple part of the
  North American-Pacific plate boundary, with no major active intersecting faults
  nearby. Below 10 to 20 km, the relative motion of the Pacific and North American
  plates apparently occurs as steady right-lateral slip at about 3.5 cm per year
  (43). Relative plate motion on the San Andreas fault at shallower depths is
  accommodated by infrequent great earthquakes southeast of Cholame and by aseismic
  slip or small shocks (or both) northwest of the preparation zone; the transition
  occurs near Parkfield (44). Within this context, the Parkfield rupture zone
  is an asperity, or &quot;stuck patch,&quot; on the fault plane approximately
  5 km wide; that is, it extends 3 to 8 km in depth and about 25 km in length.
  This patch is being loaded by slipping portions of the fault northwest of and
  beneath it, and is either completely &quot;stuck&quot; between earthquakes,
  or is slipping, but at a rate much slower than the loading rate of 3.5 cm per
  year. As such, it is an analog for large plate-boundary earthquakes on transform
  faults, which typically involve widths of 10 to 20 km and lengths of 100 km
  and greater. Thus, the Parkfield experiment is most significant in that earthquakes
  here are apparently large enough to embody the essential features of a great
  plate-boundary earthquake. There is a period of strain accumulation (in this
  case, about 20 years) when slip within the rupture zone is less than the rate
  of relative plate motion. This period is followed by the sudden slip in the
  earthquake when the rupture zone &quot;catches up.&quot; The details of the
  Crustal deformation preceding the next Parkfield earthquake should lead to a
  clearer understanding of the strain accumulation and release process at a plate
  boundary and thus should guide our efforts to predict great plate-boundary earthquakes
  elsewhere.</p>
<p>Efforts to monitor deformation at Parkfield address two specific questions: </p>
<p> 1) Will the strain release during the next earthquake be approximately the
  inverse, both in amount and distribution, of the strain accumulation since the
  1966 shock? The answer is crucial to the basic assumptions underlying earthquake
  recurrence models, such as the time-predictable and Parkfield recurrence models,
  which are the foundation of long-term prediction efforts. </p>
<p> 2) Are there changes in the details of the deformation field that might permit
  a refined estimate of the time of the next earthquake? The answer to this question
  will have a major impact on efforts toward medium- and short-term prediction. </p>
<p> Because of their importance, these questions are addressed by several projects
  to monitor deformation near Parkfield. A dense geodetic network with line lengths
  of 5 to 30 km spanning the fault has been measured every 1 to 2 years since
  1969; the lengths are measured to a precision of 0.3 to 0.5 part per million,
  so that these data should establish the aver age slip during the next earthquake
  to an accuracy of better than 10 percent (45). Because of the inherent difficulties
  of resolving slip at depth and the uncertain time scale of the strain accumulation
  process, details of the deformation changes are perhaps better resolved by other
  techniques. </p>
<p> Lengths of lines spanning the rupture zone (Fig. 4) are measured several times
  each week with a two-color laser distance-measuring device that is capable of
  resolving length changes of about 1 mm over the 5- to 8-km-long lines (46).
  These observations should provide some additional resolution of the long-term
  deformation, but more important, they should resolve details of the deformation
  within the rupture zone during the days to months before the next earthquake. </p>
<p> While the geodetic observations are relatively insensitive to long-term systematic
  errors, they are difficult to measure frequently. In efforts to overcome this
  limitation and to improve the sensitivity to short-term changes, borehole volumetric
  strainmeters (47) are being installed in the Parkfield area (Fig. 4). These
  dilatometers provide continuous data with a sensitivity of about 1 part per
  billion over periods of a few hours. The resolution of these data overlaps the
  resolution of the two-color laser measurements for periods of a few weeks and
  is one to two orders of magnitude more sensitive at shorter periods. </p>
<p> In addition, a number of low-sensitivity 10- to 20-m-long wire strainmeters
  (creepmeters) span the surface trace of the San Andreas fault near Parkfield
  (Fig. 4). These creepmeters can detect a few millimeters of anomalous fault
  slip and are well suited to detect premonitory slip of the magnitude that may
  have occurred in 1966. However, interpretation of fault creep measurements along
  the San Andreas fault is complicated by the effects of the Coalinga earthquake
  (<em>M</em><sub>L</sub> 6.7) of 2 May 1983. Not only was the character of creepmeter recordings
  along a 40-km-long section of the San Andreas fault strongly affected by the
  Coalinga earthquake (48), but an unusual swarm of small shocks 18 km southeast
  of Cholame on the locked section of the San Andreas fault occurred a few days
  after the Coalinga main shock (49).</p>
<h3> A Larger Shock</h3>

</figure>
<p> It is possible that the next characteristic Parkfield earthquake might break
  through the en echelon offset at the southeast end of the rupture zone and continue
  southeast along the San Andreas fault, growing into a major earthquake. Alternatively,
  the characteristic earthquake might stop at the en echelon offset and, by analogy
  to the triggering mechanism of the early foreshock of <em>M</em><sub>L</sub> 5.0 in 1934, increase
  the right-lateral shear stress on the fault southeast of the rupture zone. The
  latter case has been suggested (9) as the triggering mechanism for the great
  Fort Tejon earthquake of 1857. </p>
<p> Slip in 1857 along the 50-km-long section of the San Andreas fault southeast
  of Cholame was about 3.5 m, appreciably less than the 9-m offset farther southeast
  (50). Continuation of a Parkfield earthquake southeast might result in a rupture
  length of about 90 km, which is consistent with a magnitude 6.5 to 7 earthquake
  (2). Since the average Holocene offset rate across the San Andreas fault at
  Wallace Creek is 3.5 cm per year (51), it seems likely that the 3.5 m of slip
  in 1857 has largely been recovered, so that the possibility of an earthquake
  breaking this segment must be taken seriously. There are few data available
  to suggest what precursors there might be for this hypothetical larger shock.
  Minor differences in the stress field near the offset, the strength of the offset,
  and the dynamic stress ahead of the rupture could all be important (52). Although
  fore shocks or deformation (or both) at the southeast end of the Parkfield rupture
  zone might portend a shock significantly larger than a characteristic Parkfield
  earthquake, there is certainly no evidence that such precursors need occur. </p>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p> Experiments in predicting the detailed characteristics of the source of a
  significant earthquake, such as the next Parkfield earthquake, provide opportunities
  for many kinds of investigations. In addition to the elements of the prediction
  experiment, geophysical instrumentation is being deployed near Parkfield that
  will take advantage of the predicted features of the coming earthquake to address
  specific outstanding issues of earthquake mechanics. For example, a network
  of nearly 50 strong-motion accelerographs operated by the California Division
  of Mines and Geology near the Parkfield rupture zone is designed to provide
  a direct measure of the velocity of rupture, estimates of the history and amplitude
  of the seismic slip along the rupture length, detailed information about high-frequency
  radiation and directivity effects, and a test of the idea that the low-rigidity
  fault zone might act as a wave guide that significantly distorts seismic radiation
  (53). </p>
<p> Two fundamentally different models of the earthquake generation process have
  been used in our description of the phenomena at Parkfield. The propagating
  crack models (type 1) derived from analyses of seismograms feature discontinuous
  slip beginning at a point (the hypocenter) and expanding over the rupture surface
  (54). For these type 1 models, precursory aseismic slip is generally not considered,
  precursors are expected near the epicenter (the preparation zone), and the preparation
  zone is viewed as a relatively strong point on the fault surface. The evidence
  for larger stress drops for earthquakes within the Parkfield preparation zone
  would support the type 1 models. However, laboratory experiments in rock mechanics
  (42) suggest that stick-slip events-the earthquake analog in rock mechanics-are
  always preceded by stable sliding-the fault creep analog in rock mechanics.
  These observations have been used in support of strain-softening models (type
  2) of the earthquake generation process (42). For these type 2 models, at least
  some precursory aseismic slip is required near the hypocenter; zones of precursory
  aseismic slip might have significant lateral extent, perhaps extending beyond
  the preparation zone. For the type 2 models, earthquake precursors should be
  concentrated near the relatively weak places on the fault surface where the
  aseismic slip occurs. The anecdotal reports of the broken irrigation pipeline
  and the en echelon cracks observed before the 1966 Parkfield earthquake are
  qualitative evidence supporting the type 2 strain-softening models of the earthquake
  generation process. The evaluation of these two different types of models, implicit
  in the design of the Parkfield prediction experiment, is essential before focused
  efforts to record short-term precursors can be undertaken in other earthquake-prone
  areas.</p>
