<figcaption>Fig. 2.(a) The Parkfield recurrence<font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>1</sub> represents the failure stress of the fault. Most characteristic earthquakes
      occur at <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>1</sub>; the 1934 shock
        occurred at <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>2</sub>. A constant loading
        rate of 2.8 cm per year and a coseismic slip of 60 cm for the Parkfield
        earthquake sequences in 1881, 1901,1922,1934, and 1966 are assumed (56).
        (b) Series of earthquake sequences at Parkfield since 1850 [after (5)],
        The line represents the linear regression of the time of the sequence
        obtained without the 1934 sequence, The anticipated time of the seventh
        (that is, the next) Parkfield sequence for the regression is January 1988.
        (c) Shocks of M<sub>L</sub> greater than 4 since 1930 have tended
        to occur when the stress exceeds <font face="Symbol">s</font><sub>2 </sub>.</figcaption></figure>
