						<p>The geophysical instruments operated at Parkfield by the USGS and its collaborators are designed to monitor tectonic processes leading up to the expected earthquake and to record the strong shaking and crustal deformation that will result from it. Because the anticipated earthquake is expected to resemble historic Parkfield earthquakes, especially the 1966 event, data from previous shocks were used to guide the design of the monitoring networks. For example, the rupture zone of the 1966 earthquake and the locations of the 1966 hypocenter and 1934 and 1966 foreshocks near the rupture zone's north end are areas of intense monitoring. Some monitoring efforts have been discontinued, but most are currently operating.</p>
