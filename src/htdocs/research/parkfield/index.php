    The Parkfield Experiment is a comprehensive, long-term earthquake research
    project on the San Andreas fault. Led by the USGS and the State of
    California, the experiment's purpose is to better understand the physics
    of earthquakes - what actually happens on the fault and in the surrounding
    region before, during and after an earthquake. Ultimately, scientists hope
    to better understand the earthquake process and, if possible, to provide a
    scientific basis for earthquake prediction. Since its inception in 1985,
    the experiment has involved more than 100 researchers at the USGS and
    collaborating universities and government laboratories. Their coordinated
    efforts have led to a dense network of instruments poised to
    &quot;capture&quot; the anticipated earthquake and reveal the earthquake
    process in unprecedented detail.
  </p>
  <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
  <p>
    Moderate-size earthquakes of about magnitude 6 have occurred on the
    Parkfield section of the San Andreas fault at fairly regular intervals -
    in 1857, 1881, 1901, 1922, 1934, and 1966. The first, in 1857, was a
    foreshock to the great Fort Tejon earthquake which ruptured the fault from
    Parkfield to the southeast for over 180 miles. Available data suggest that
    all six moderate-sized Parkfield earthquakes may have been
    &quot;characteristic&quot; in the sense that they all ruptured the same
    area on the fault. If such characteristic ruptures occur regularly, then
    the next quake would have been due before 1993.

    These pages describe the scientific background for the experiment,
    including the tectonic setting at Parkfield, the historical earthquake
    activity on this section of the San Andreas fault, the monitoring and data
    collecting activities currently being carried out, and plans for future
    research. Data are available to view in real-time and download.
  </p>
  <h3>Scientific Advances</h3>
  <p>
    While the greatest scientific payoff is expected when the earthquake
    occurs, our understanding of the earthquake process has already been
    advanced through research results from Parkfield. Some of the highlights
    are described.
  </p>
  <h3>Data</h3>
  <p>
    Real-time data from instrumentation networks running at Parkfield are
    available for viewing and downloading.

    <p>The exhibit was a geologically interactive, seismic machine earthwork temporarily installed in Parkfield in 2008. Rogers presented the history, conceptual premise, documentation of the work, and also put forward the idea of how early 21st century cultural practice could be used to encourage earthquake awareness and preparedness.</p>

    The <a href="/research/parkfield/town.html">Town of Parkfield</a>,
    located on the San Andreas fault in central California, has been the
    site of an intensive, multidisciplinary earthquake study since the late
    1970's. The goal is to observe the fault and surrounding crust at close
    range at the time before, during and after an earthquake, to better
    understand the earthquake process and provide a scientific basis for
    earthquake prediction. <a href="/research/parkfield/networkmap.html"
