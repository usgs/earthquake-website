    <h2>Annual Competitive Grants</h2>
    <p>
      External Grants issues an annual Program announcement for competitive proposals for grants and cooperative agreements to support research in earthquake hazards, the physics of earthquakes, earthquake occurrence, and earthquake safety policy.
    </p>

    <p>
      During the Application period, applicants must submit proposals and other required documents through <a href="http://www.grants.gov/">Grants.gov</a>; paper copies will not be accepted.  Please note that the requirements and other guidance for submitting proposals, as wells as annual updates of research priorities, referred to as the Program Announcement, can only be accessed through <a href="http://www.grants.gov/">www.grants.gov</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The application period is generally open from early March to mid-May. <a href="http://www.grants.gov/web/grants/manage-subscriptions.html">Sign up for subscription notices from Grants.gov</a> regarding <i>"CFDA number 15.807 application period openings"</i>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>A link to the application will be posted here during the application period.</strong>

<h2>About External Research Grants</h2>

<p>
  The <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/">U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)</a> provides
  support for research that will assist in achieving the goals of the Earthquake
  Hazards Program. The goal is to mitigate earthquake losses that can occur in
  many parts of the nation by providing earth science data and assessments
  essential for land-use planning, engineering design, and emergency
  preparedness decisions.
</p>

<p>
  The USGS participates in earthquake science activities with the <a
  href="http://www.nsf.gov/">National Science Foundation (NSF)</a>, the<a
  href="http://www.fema.gov/"> Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)</a>,
  the <a href="http://www.nehrp.gov/">National Earthquake Hazards Reduction
  Program (NEHRP)</a> and the <a href="http://www.nist.gov/"> National Institute
  of Standards and Technology (NIST)</a>, the last having the lead role to plan
  and coordinate the national effort. In addition to activities performed by
  USGS staff, expertise in earthquake studies that exist outside the Federal
  Government is applied through a substantial program of grants, cooperative
  agreements, and/or contracts with universities, state, regional and local
  government agencies, and private industry. External research is solicited in
  order to develop information, knowledge, and methods which are relevant to the
  major program elements.
</p>

<p>
  Specific objectives and research tasks identified as measures of progress
  towards the goals of these program elements are described in greater detail in
  the past or current Research Priorities section of the <a
  href="http://www.usgs.gov/contracts/nehrp/">Announcement of Funding
  Opportunities</a>. The application period for grants is generally open from
  mid-February until mid-May each year.
</p>

<p>
  Unsolicited Proposals may be submitted out of cycle only in cases where there is a compelling circumstance or emergency that must be acted on before the next competitive grant cycle.&nbsp; Proposers should contact the appropriate Regional or Topical Coordinator prior to submitting out-of-cycle proposals. See <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/contracts/unsolbk.html">Guidance for submitting unsolicited proposals</a>.
