The Recipient must publish project reports in scientific or technical journals, in a peer-reviewed form.
</p>
<p>
  Data generated as a part of work funded by the Earthquake Hazards Program is not subject to a proprietary period of exclusive data access. Any data generated must be made available to the USGS as soon as it is available. The USGS reserves a royalty-free, nonexclusive and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use, and to authorize others to use, data for government purposes.

<h3>No-Cost Extensions</h3>

  No-cost Extensions are discouraged. The timely conduct of funded projects is of great importance to the achievement of EHP goals. The USGS reserves the right to limit the length of time and number of no-cost extensions. Requests for no-cost extensions will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Please note that no-cost extensions are not intended to be used merely for the purpose of expending unobligated balances. Request for no-cost extensions shall be submitted to the Contracting Officer <strong>at least 45 days</strong> before the grant end date. A request for an extension that is received by the Contracting Officer after the expiration date shall not be honored. Requests may be made via email to the Contracting Officer.

<p>
  Applicants must supply the following documentation supporting their request for an extension:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cause of the needed extension</li>
  <li>Description of the remaining work to be completed</li>

</ul>
<p>
  The Contracting Officer will notify the Recipient in writing within 30 calendar days after receipt of the request for revision or adjustment whether the request has been approved.
