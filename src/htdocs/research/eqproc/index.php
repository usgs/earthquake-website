  	The overarching theme of this research is for scientists to discover as much as they can about earthquakes and faulting from field and laboratory observations, and to combine this with geophysical, geological, geochemical, and mathematical (including computational) modeling of earthquake sources and fault zones so as to best improve USGS earthquake hazard assessments.
	</p>
	<p>
  	The high level of earthquake activity and the complexity of the fault systems throughout California area provides a unique natural laboratory for the study of the physics of earthquakes. Scientists are studying fault interaction by comparing the seismic behavior in California to analogous areas in the world with large strike-slip faults, to provide insight into possible past and future earthquakes in the region.
	</p>
	<p>
    In addition, earthquakes are generated in the laboratory under controlled conditions to learn how they start and what indications there might be that they are about to happen. Also, fault zone materials are carefully tested to learn about the physical and chemical processes that control earthquakes.
  </p>
	<p>
  	This research strives to increase the quality and impact of these products, and to reduce their uncertainties, through multidisciplinary research aimed at better understanding the earthquake process. The project works in close collaboration with regionally focused projects and with the <a href="/hazards/">National Seismic Hazard Mapping (NSHM)</a> project in order to support those efforts at issuing earthquake hazard products.
	</p>

	<h3>Some of the key scientific questions scientists seek to answer:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>How is stress loaded onto faults as a function of space and time by both plate motions and other geological processes?</li>
		<li>How do the stresses redistributed by one earthquake affect the probability of future events?</li>
		<li>Do identifiable earthquakes recur with some average repeat time and definable variation or is each earthquake unique?</li>
		<li>How does the structure of faults control the nucleation of small earthquakes and their growth into larger ones and what does this predict about the distribution of sizes of earthquakes we can expect in a region or along a fault?</li>
	</ul>

<h2>Tracking Stress Buildup</h2>

<figure class='left w300'>
	<img src="images/stressrate.jpg" alt=""/>

  </pfigcaption>
</div>

<p>The constant plate tectonic motions between the Pacific and North American plates guarantees that the crust in the western US is continually building up stress. The image of crustal velocities provided by extensive GPS coverage reveals where these velocities change rapidly over short distances, demanding that the intervening crustal rock stretch and build up stress over time. Such a map of the stress reveals two main lines where stress is concentrated: The San Andreas fault zone and the Eastern California Shear Zone. These zones have experienced numerous earthquakes over the century and a half that earthquakes have been historically observed.</p>

<p>The mechanism of stress buildup within these fault zones is uncertain. One hypothesis is that the hot rocks below the upper 15-km-thick layer (the upper crust that has the vast majority of continental earthquakes) flows continually in response to periodic earthquakes, forcing the upper crust to bend with this flow. Another hypothesis is that slip of the deeper continuation of faults, steady slip that doesn&rsquo;t produce earthquakes but still involves motions across the fault, forces the upper crust around the faults to bend and thus concentrate stress. Both hypotheses are the subject of active research. But the fact remains that high stressing rates observed on the surface likely translate to high stressing rates at the depths (~10 km) where earthquakes typically nucleate, so these stressing rates are a guide to the seismic hazard.</p>

<h2>Crustal Deformation</h2>

<p>
  Crustal deformation refers to the changing earth&rsquo;s surface caused by tectonic forces that are accumulated in the crust and then cause earthquakes. So understanding the details of deformation and its effects on faults is important for figuring out which faults are most likely to produce the next earthquake. There are several hypotheses about how this works, but more data is needed to determine which one is the best.
</p>

<p>
  Crustal deformation is a heavily data driven field. To measure the motions of earth&rsquo;s surface, the USGS employs a variety of methods, including LIDAR, the Global Positioning System (GPS), Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), creepmeters, and alinement arrays.  In parts of the U.S. with few or no historically-recorded major earthquakes or where background seismicity is sparse, geodetic data may provide the only insight into present-day seismic hazard. The motions captured by these diverse measurement techniques provide vital information on:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>The slow &lsquo;background&rsquo; tectonic motions between the earth&rsquo;s plates, thereby constraining the buildup of stress on faults.</li>
	<li>The offsets across creeping faults such as the Hayward fault, which results in steady motions (typically several millimeters per year) of blocks of crust moving past each other along a common fault boundary.</li>
	<li>The offsets across a fault during a large earthquake (the coseismic displacements).</li>
	<li>Rapidly decaying motions that persist for weeks to years after a large earthquake, arising from a combination of continued slip on the fault (&lsquo;afterslip&rsquo;) and possibly its extension into the lower crust and flow of rock in the deeper lower crust and mantle, where the temperature is high enough to permit ductile flow.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Specific problems of interest include:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Quantifying fault slip rates, creep rates, and off-fault strain rates as well as the spatial extent of locked and creeping zones.</li>
	<li>Deformation rates between earthquakes with different recurrence intervals.</li>
	<li>Comparing models with observed data to assess the accuracy of each.</li>
	<li>Mapping the distribution of the locked (non-slipping) and freely sliding parts of faults to determine where slip in future earthquakes will occur.</li>
	<li>Improving earthquake early warning and rapid response using real time high rate GPS data.</li>
	<li>Investigating the effects of seismic waves travelling across a fault from an earthquake on another fault.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fault Slip Rates</h2>

<figure class='left w300'>
	<img src="images/gps-sites.jpg" alt=""/>
	<figcaption>
    The USGS has been monitoring the Bartlett Springs fault and Maacama fault with continuous and campaign GPS instruments since 2006. GPS and alinement arrays around these faults are designed to capture long-term movements as well as shallow creep rates.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  Earth&rsquo;s crust typically moves a few millimeters to centimeters per year. In an actively deforming continental region, the crust often behaves like a set of nearly-rigid blocks separated by faults. The velocity within a block is nearly constant, but the velocity may differ substantially from one block to an adjacent one. Whether the transition in velocity across a bounding fault is abrupt or gradual depends on whether the fault is creeping (abrupt transition) or locked (gradual transition). The distinction is important because a gradual transition implies not only that the fault is locked but that it is accumulating stress that will eventually lead to earthquakes.
</p>

<p>
  An example is the horizontal crustal deformation field in the northern San Francisco Bay area. The crust is approximated as three blocks, their boundaries lying along the right-lateral strike-slip San Andreas fault, Macaama fault, and Bartlett Springs fault. Motions across the San Andreas fault, southern Macaama fault, and southern Bartlett Springs fault are gradual, but those across the northern Macaama fault and northern Bartlett Springs fault are abrupt in several areas, implying some degree of fault creep.
</p>

<p>
  A recent study by Murray, Minson, and Svarc employs use a Bayesian technique to interpret the GPS crustal velocity field to estimate deep slip rates and shallow surface creep. Their model indicates a deep slip rate of 20 mm/yr for the San Andreas fault, a deep slip rate of 13 mm/yr and shallow creep rate of 0 to 13 mm/yr on the Maacama fault, and a deep slip rate of 7 mm/yr and shallow creep rate of 0 to 7 mm/yr along the Bartlett Springs fault.

The long-term slip rate of each fault is ideally its deep slip rate; the shallow portion of each faults catches up to the (generally higher) velocity of the deeper portion episodically, i.e. during earthquakes.  The higher the shallow slip rate, the more the fault is creeping, hence the lower the expected size of earthquakes.

<h2>Post-Earthquake Motions</h2>

<p>
  After a large earthquake, the crust does not stop moving.  Earthquakes such as the 1994 M6.7 Northridge, California, or 1989 M6.9 Loma Prieta, California, earthquakes are followed by hundreds of aftershocks, some of them damaging. Many aftershocks occur on the causative fault or its extension into the deeper earth.  The slip associated with these aftershocks is termed afterslip.   It may occur in the form of ordinary earthquakes or as slow slip that is not felt.
</p>
<p>
  Another process that occurs after an earthquake is relaxation of the ductile rock that underlies the uppermost crust.  While most earthquakes occur in the uppermost crust because frictional resistance is high (and hence stress builds up over long periods of time), few occur in the deeper crust or underlying mantle because the rock temperature is too high to permit accumulation of stress.  Instead, stress is accommodated by flow of the rock.  The depth where the transition from brittle friction to ductile flow is called the brittle-ductile transition, and it generally coincides with the maximum depth of earthquakes, typically 10-20 km (<a href="http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2003/of03-214/WG02_OFR-03-214_AppendixA.pdf">Implications of the Depth of Seismicity for the Rupture Extent of Future Earthquakes in the San Francisco Bay Area</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Understanding these processes is important for estimating how faults interact with one another through stress transfer, which can change the seismic hazard for years after an earthquake.  Part of this understanding comes from better knowledge of the temperature and composition of rocks deep beneath earth&rsquo;s surface.

<h3>Case Study: M7.1 October 16, 1999 Hector Mine, California, Earthquake</h3>

<figure class='left w300'>
  <img src="images/hectormine.jpg" alt=""/>
  <figcaption>
    One of the most illuminating examples of using GPS data
to learn about afterslip and relaxation is in the aftermath
of the M7.1 October 16, 1999, Hector Mine, California,
earthquake.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  The Hector Mine earthquake occurred in the central Mojave Desert and produced several meters of slip along faults of total length ~40 km.   It was well-recorded by continuous GPS sites of the SCIGN Network that were already in place in the aftermath of the 1992 M7.3 Landers earthquake, as well as new continuous and survey-mode GPS that were installed in the region by scientists soon after the Hector Mine quake.
</p>
<p>
  Both afterslip on thin zones below the causative fault and relaxation of the flowing lower crust and mantle occurred in the months and years after the Hector Mine earthquake.
</p>
<p>
  2.5 years after the 1999 Hector Mine quake quake, almost all regional motions above the &lsquo;background&rsquo; tectonic motions are due to flow of rock in the lower crust and upper mantle.  This motion can be tracked unambiguously up to 10.46 years after the 1999 Hector Mine quake, at which time the M7.2 April 4, 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake changed the regional flow pattern. A model of the flow based on the laboratory behavior of wet olivine and mafic granulite compositions (Thatcher and Pollitz, 2008) agrees well with observed motions.

<p>
  Measureable permanent ground displacements are produced by shallow earthquakes of magnitude 5 and greater. These displacements are used by seismologists to understand the earthquake source in detail, such as the amount of slip and the type of underground fault which ruptured. This information has been traditionally used to analyze earthquakes long after they occur, but recent work in <a href="/research/earlywarning/">Earthquake Early Warning</a> may allow such geodetic measurements to be exploited in real time in order to help provide warning of earthquake shaking while the earthquake is in progress.
</p>
<p>
  Steady background motions of Earth&rsquo;s crust occur as a result of tectonic plate motions. As the Pacific plate slides past the North American plate, they become stuck at the boundary zone between them, which typically has many faults. If these faults are stuck, then there may be no motion across them for tens to hundreds of years, during which time they build up stress until an earthquake occurs. The earthquake relieves the stress, the fault is stuck again, and the cycle of stress buildup and release begins anew. This process has been documented on the Hayward fault and San Andreas fault for the past few thousand years using geologic investigations.
</p>
<p>
  Many faults in the San Francisco Bay area are not completely stuck, but instead they undergo fault creep, steady motions along the fault. If these motions proceed as rapidly as the plates slide past each other, then the fault is essentially &lsquo;unstuck&rsquo; and no stress builds up. This is the case for portions of the Hayward fault, Calaveras fault, and <a href="/monitoring/edm/parkfield/continuous.php">San Andreas fault</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Measureable motions above the &lsquo;background&rsquo; often occur days, months, or even years after an earthquake occurs, even though the causative faults are stuck. This usually happens after magnitude > 7 earthquakes. Such motions continued for several years following the 1999 M7.1 Hector Mine earthquake in the Mojave Desert, California. Such large earthquake impart large stresses into the Earth&rsquo;s lower crust and mantle, the layer between the crust and the core. The lower crust and mantle have higher temperature than the upper crust (the upper ~15 km), and minerals like quartz will flow at these higher temperatures. As a result, stresses that lead to earthquakes tend to be concentrated in the continental upper crust, but the gradual dissipation of these stresses in the ductile layer will lead to continued crustal motions for years after a large earthquake.
</p>
<p>
  Some &lsquo;earthquakes&rsquo; occur without shaking. Scientists often refer to these events as slow earthquakes. Many slow earthquakes occur along the Cascadia subduction zone, where the Juan de fuca plate is plunging beneath the North American plate . Many also occur in the San Francisco Bay area, specifically along the creeping central San Andreas fault.

<p>
  Faults are thought to be creeping at depth in the lower crust, where the lack of frictional resistance at the prevailing high temperatures allows steady fault slip and no buildup of stress.  Faults may also be creeping at shallower depth in the upper crust (left figure), leading to block-like motions and sharp changes in surface velocity across the fault.  Faults are usually locked in the upper crust (right figure), leading to a gradual change in surface velocity across the fault and bending of the upper crust.  This bending produces stress buildup that eventually leads to earthquakes.
</p>
<p>
  The horizontal velocity field in the San Francisco Bay area is constrained by <a href="/monitoring/gps/">continuous GPS (CGPS) and survey-mode GPS (SGPS) measurements</a>. These velocities are almost parallel to the regional faults and decrease from west to east as one approaches the interior of the North American plate.  While a gradual transition across the San Andreas Fault indicates that it is locked, the abrupt transition across the southern Hayward fault indicates that it is creeping.  This is confirmed by <a href="/monitoring/deformation/data/plots/?region=SF">creepmeter measurements across the Hayward fault</a>.

<h2>Ground Shaking</h2>

<figure class='left w300'>
  <img src="images/effects.jpg" alt="image of expected shaking amplification in LA Basin">
  <figcaption>
    Two important local geologic factors that affect the level of shaking experienced in earthquakes are (1) the softness of the surface rocks and (2) the thickness of surface sediments. This image of the Los Angeles region combines this information to predict the total amplification expected in future earthquakes from local geologic conditions or site effects.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
  The overall objective of this research is to improve the understanding of the damaging ground motions produced in earthquakes in order to develop better methods for seismic hazard assessment and mitigation in urban areas. Past earthquakes have shown that the amplification of motions due to surface-to-bedrock geology, 3D crustal structure, and topography have a major influence on seismic damage and loss in urban areas. Also of significant importance are the details of the rupture process on the fault, and the way a built structure is engineered.
</p>
<p>
	As the waves propagate they are affected by the earth structure, such as changes in elastic properties resulting in effects such as constructive and destructive interference and basin amplification. Near the ground surface, strong shaking can result in nonlinear soil behavior or raise pore fluid pressure causing liquefaction. Likewise, the geometry of a man-made structure, the construction materials, the type of ground, and its anchorage in the ground affect its vulnerability to damage during the shaking. This research aims to understand each of these processes and to work with the seismic engineering community to bring the best estimates of strong ground shaking to engineering practice.
</p>

<h3>Research includes:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>investigation of the ground beneath high-impact areas to understand the shaking that would occur in a large earthquake.</li>
	<li>investigation of the effect on seismic waves of traveling long distances through the earth’s crust, sedimentary basins, mountains, and other crustal features.</li>
	<li>development of better imaging methods for identifying faults and crustal structure.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ground Failure</h2>

<p>
	This research focuses on the ability to determine what areas are more prone to experiencing effects such as liquefaction and landslides when there is shaking from an earthquake. Cone penetration testing (CPT) provides much of the data.
</p>

<h3>Cone Penetration Testing (CPT)</h3>

<p>
  Cone Penetration Testing (CPT) is used to identify subsurface conditions in the upper 100 ft of the subsurface. The USGS CPT uses a 23-ton truck to push a “cone” into the ground. The weight of the truck is partially supported by both the tip of the cone and the sleeve of the cone. The “tip resistance” is determined by the force required to push the tip of the cone and the “sleeve friction” is determined by the force required to push the sleeve through the soil. The “friction ratio” is the ratio between sleeve friction and tip resistance, measured as a percentage. Soil type and thereby resistance to liquefaction can be inferred from these measurements.
</p>

</figure>

<figure class='right'>
  <img src="images/truckseis.jpg" alt="photo of shaking truck and person"/>
</figure>

<p>
  <a href="/research/cpt/data/">Data from the USGS cone,</a> which includes a seismometer, can also be used to predict how local shallow soil conditions can modify shaking. The capacity of local soil conditions to modify shaking is inversely proportional to the shear-wave velocity near the surface, which can be computed with data recorded with the seismometer. Seismic energy is created manually with a sledgehammer or automatically by a compressed air driven hammer. We measure the time it takes for the seismic energy to travel from the land surface, through the ground, to the seismometer mounted in the cone. The distance to the seismometer divided by the travel time of the shear-wave is approximately the average shear-wave velocity.
</p>
<p>
  Output from the cone as it penetrates the soil is digitally recorded by a computer and is collectively known as a sounding.
