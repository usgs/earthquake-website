Within the central and eastern United States, the number of earthquakes has increased dramatically over the past few years. Are they natural, or man-made?
And what should be done in the future?

          Between the years 1973&ndash;2008, there was an average of 21 earthquakes of magnitude three and larger in the central and eastern United States. This rate jumped to an average of 99 M3+ earthquakes per year in 2009&ndash;2013, and the rate continues to rise.

          The USGS is currently studying seismicity that may be induced at 6 locations across the United States. These studies involve earthquake monitoring, examining industrial data, and evaluating any relationships between seismicity and industrial actions.

          The USGS is currently developing new methods to evaluate the hazard due to induced earthquakes. These methods will account for the rapid changes in earthquake rate that we have witnessed in the past few years.
